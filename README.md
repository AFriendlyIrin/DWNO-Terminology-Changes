# Digimon World: Next Order - Terminology Changes
Cosmetic mod altering some terminologies in Digimon World: Next Order. Changes Digimon stage names to their Japanese counterparts, fixes some questionable terminology translations, and tweaks a few other names to ones I believe flow better or make more sense.

The English language CSVs have been provided here if you wish to make your own adjustments. **Note: If you are editing the CSVs with spreadsheet software, you must import the hash column as text to avoid errors.**

Additionally, there are a few miscellaneous corrections:
* Some Digimon's special moves have been changed to more accurate translations (most notably, Pummel Whack → Fist of the Supreme King & Diamond Storm → Fox Arrows, with the quiz questions updated accordingly)
* Fixed the error in Vikemon's contingency message (he now says to get rid of any Black Digitrout instead of "I'll take that off your hands")
* Corrected Ophanimon's pronouns to female in her recruitment message
* Fixed an it's/its mistake in one of the item descriptions

## Installation
Only the raw asset files are provided. You will need to pack them into `DigimonDataR.cpk` using a CPK file tool. If you do this, the mod is compatible with the Switch version on any custom firmware with LayeredFS compatibility.

## Known Issues
Replacing all 6 files in the CPK causes the game to crash when loading certain areas. It's not any particular file, it's just any 6 file changes. I have no idea why this happens, but choose 1 file to exclude until the problem can be resolved.
