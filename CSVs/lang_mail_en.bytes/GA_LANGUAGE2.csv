"mailCode1","<title>Bringing Digimon to town...</title>
<body>Let's start by looking on Nigh Plains
for Digimon to call into town.
That seems like a good place to start.

But don't forget it's very dangerous.
It will be safer to get your partner to
Child status before heading out.</body>"
"mailCode2","<title>Come back to town!</title>
<body>The Digimon search is going well.

Thanks to you, I have been able to get a
lot of information from the Digimon in
town.

When you have a spare minute, why don't
you visit me at home?</body>"
"mailCode3","<title>South of Nigh Plains</title>
<body>There are more humans out there...
What a surprise!

Witnesses say they're in the area of
Power Plant #2 south of Nigh Plains.

Leave the town and just head south.</body>"
"mailCode4","<title>Thanks!</title>
​<body>Thank you again!
​It is a big relief that there are humans
other than me and ​Himari</body>"
"mailCode5","<title>It's Himari!</title>
<body>I'm so glad we met!
But it's really strange that someone has
TWO Digimon partners! Really weird...</body>"
"mailCode6","<title>Head to Logic Volcano!</title>
<body>Taomon has a place where it can meditate
halfway up Logic Volcano.

It's to the south of Noise Storm, next
to Server Desert west of Nigh Plains.
Leave town and go west, south and south.

It's going to be a long journey...</body>"
"mailCode7","<title>Burying seeds</title>
<body>Taomon is really weird... What's up with
suddenly asking us to bury the seeds?

Where can we even bury the seeds?

Oh! I know! There is a place at Power
Plant #2 in Nigh Plains where you might
be able to bury them!</body>"
"mailCode8","<title>Going back to Taomon's!</title>
<body>That was a very strange flower...

Let's not worry about it now and go back
to Taomon's instead.
We'll see you there!</body>"
"mailCode9","<title>Back in town!</title>
<body>My socks were blown off when I saw
Taomon was back!

Anyway, now we can work on building the
Machinedramon Detector!

I need to talk to you about it...
Come over to my house for a quick chat!</body>"
"mailCode10","<title>Creating a Digimon town</title>
<body>I still need some time before the
Machinedramon Detector is ready.

Until then, you should keep looking for
Digimon to live in the town!</body>"
"mailCode11","<title>Coming back to town?</title>
<body>Is the resident search going well?
I have almost finished my Machinedramon
Detector.

Why don't you come over to see me do the
finishing touches to it?</body>"
"mailCode12","<title>Going to the Server Desert!</title>
<body>I'm heading to the Dead End Town in the
western part of the Server Desert.

Leave town and just keep heading west!

The sandstorms can be a real pain, but
keep following the signs. You'll be OK!</body>"
"mailCode13","<title>Coming back to town?</title>
<body>Things are calmer now that there is no
sign of the Machinedramon.

Come back to town so that I can fill you
in.</body>"
"mailCode14","<title>Invite more Digimon to join us!</title>
<body>Everyone just seems to be waiting around
for some new signal.

You should keep looking for residents
until there is some new development.</body>"
"mailCode15","<title>Back in town!</title>
<body>The Machinedramon Detector is reacting
to something!

Hurry back to my house, right away!</body>"
"mailCode16","<title>Going to the Server Desert!</title>
<body>I'm going to Stepstep in the northeast
of the Server Desert!

Leave town and go west, west, north!

You need to be ready to fight off some
Machinedramon again!</body>"
"mailCode17","<title>Invite more Digimon to join us!</title>
<body>I'm worried about what that Mirei said
but not only do I not have any ideas...
I also can't move from here...

Right now I want us to stay focused on
bringing more Digimon to the town.</body>"
"mailCode18","<title>URGENT! Come back to town!</title>
<body>{0}, we're in trouble here!
You need to come and find me right now!</body>"
"mailCode19","<title>I'm at Faulty Ex Machina!</title>
<body>{0}, help me!
I didn't listen to Himari and now I'm
far, far away...
I went to Faulty Ex Machina...
I'm to the north of the Palace of
Thorns, which is in the plains after the
desert! Please help me!</body>"
"mailCode20","DO NOT TRANSLATE"
"mailCode21","<title>Come to MOD Cape.</title>
<body>How is it going over there?
I want to tell you something...
Something is up with Kouta.
Honestly, I can't handle it...

I'm waiting for you at MOD Cape.
Come as quickly as you can!</body>"
"mailCode22","<title>Come back to town.</title>
<body>Yukimura had been lost to the BH
Program, just like Rikka...

But thanks to you, {0},
there was a happy ending.
I want to hold a debriefing meeting, so
please come over to my home.</body>"
"mailCode23","<title>Invite more Digimon to join us!</title>
<body>To locate the damaged part of the cable,
we need to collect some information.

If you bring more Digimon to the town,
we'll be able to get what we need.
Good luck!</body>
"
"mailCode24","<title>Come back to town.</title>
<body>You've been doing good work!
We have enough now to narrow down where
exactly the cable is damaged.

Can you come to Jijimon's house to take
a look at what we've discovered?</body>"
"mailCode25","<title>Go to Faulty Ex Machina!</title>
​<body>The section of cable which needs repair
​is on the east shore of Faulty Ex
​Machina you can get there through the MOD
​Ship 3.0.</body>"
"mailCode26","<title>Come back to town.</title>
<body>It looks like you've completed the
repair. Good work!

Be careful on the way home!</body>"
"mailCode27","<title>Look for Datamon!</title>
<body>We need Datamon's help to complete the
antivirus program.

I think Datamon is in Nigh Plains, but
Yuramon in the town knows more about
Datamon's precise location.</body>"
"mailCode28","<title>See you in town?</title>
<body>Datamon seems all right.
I'll be waiting for your return.
Be careful out there!</body>"
"mailCode29","<title>Go to Server Tower.</title>
<body>We have to stop the enemy at Server
Tower before they get even stronger!

Server Tower is southwest of the Server
Graveyard.

Leave town and go west, west, southwest,
south and west. Be careful!</body>"
"mailCode30","<title>Invite more Digimon!</title>
<body>We need the help of even more residents
to raise Floatia.

The only one who can help us is you.
You can take on the BH Program.

We're counting on you!</body>"
"mailCode31","<title>Come back to town.</title>
<body>Thanks to you, {0}, we have
got what we need to levitate Floatia!

Everyone is so excited to see Floatia up in
the sky!
Come back safely!</body>"
"mailCode32","<title>The town is floating!</title>
<body>I can't believe we got attacked at the
worst possible moment...

But at least we levitated the town.
To come back, use the phone booth.</body>"
"mailCode33","<title>Waiting at Nigh Plains...</title>
<body>If you get this... Come to the Vast
Plateau on Nigh Plains...</body>"
"mailCode34","<title>Come to Bony Resort.</title>
<body>You just need to set the trap
properly... But you need to set it up on
the top of the mountain of Bony Resort
to the west of Ohguino Wastelands
in the Pink Stone House.

It's a long journey so make sure you're
well prepared.</body>"
"mailCode35","<title>Invite more Digimon!</title>
<body>We're not developed enough in Floatia
for Reincarnation to be possible.
It goes without saying that Floatia
relies on the Digimon.

So for further development, we need the
help of even more Digimon!</body>"
"mailCode36","<title>Come back to town!</title>
<body>Luche has finished her analysis.
Come to Jijimon's house to find out
more!</body>"
"mailCode37","<title>Invite more Digimon!</title>
<body>Luche was a Digimon all along...
I really can't believe it...
But Luche never committed a crime.
Tsuzuki was in the wrong. 

It is Tsuzuki who we really need to stop!
And that's why we need more residents!</body>"
"mailCode38","<title>Come back to town!</title>
<body>The groundwork is finished.
Now I need to tell you something
important about the Reincarnation.

Can you come over to Jijimon's house so
we can go over it?</body>"
"mailCode39","<title>This is the final battle!</title>
<body>Now is our crucial test!
You can get to the Singular Zone from
Ruins Lake in Nigh Plains!

This will be the very final battle.
Make sure that your Digimon are ready!
We're all counting on you!</body>"
"mailCode40","<title>To Infinite Cauldron!</title>
<body>He must be at Infinite Cauldron!
Make sure you're ready for anything!</body>"
"mailCode41","<title>Keep going!</title>
<body>He's run even farther than we thought.
Keep going! We can't lose him now!</body>"
"mailCode42","<title>To the Dimensional District!</title>
<body>We're picking up his signal in the
Dimensional District.
This time, you can defeat him!
Make sure you're ready!</body>"
"mailCode43","<title>Thank you!</title>
<body>We'd never have defeated him without
you. You never fail to impress.
But you've always been the strong one...
Thank you, {0}.</body>"
"mailCode44","<title>Is the population growing?</title>
<body>I have something regarding Floatia I need to
talk to you about.

When you have a moment, please come to
my house.
</body>"
"mailCode45","<title>Ask Botamon</title>
<body>Is your Digimon search going well? I've
picked up lots of information about
Digimon, and asked the Botamon in my
house to pass it on to you. If you need
any help, go talk to him!</body>"
