you're not a bad guy?!"
"33e75a30","...You know Jijimon?
Don't tell me...you're not a bad guy?!"
"34e75ba3","{0} explained the situation."
"35e75d16","Is that right? My bad... I got a bit ahead of myself."
"36e75e89","I've never seen a human before, y'see..."
"3fe76cd4","Right, then. I'm going back to Floatia. Gimme a holler if
you see me out there!"
"40e76e47","Patamon joined the city!"
"1f2ae571","Here I go! HNNNGH! HUP! ...Dang. I can't do it."
"1c2ae0b8","I want to fly all through the sky! The thing is, though, I'm
not very good at it..."
"1d2ae22b","Won't someone teach me how to fly?"
"222ae9ca","Keep trying, you'll get it!
I don't think it's possible."
"232aebbd","I will, thanks! If you meet any Digimon that could give some
pointers, please let me know!"

"8fa00162","Hmm, it's no good... I can't think of anything..."
"8e9fff8f","I may be weak, but I want to help people. The problem is, my
only skill is making this thread..."
"8d9ffe1c","I'm confident in its strength, but what can I use it for?"
"8c9ffca9","How about knitting?
Make it into a lifeline?
Use it for fishing line."
"8b9ffb36","Knitting, huh...but how could that help people? Hmm...
I get the feeling there's a better solution..."
"8a9ff943","I'll think about it a bit more..."
"899ff7d0","It'd be perfect for helping people, but...I don't want to
think about what'd happen if it broke!"
"98a00f4d","If someone got hurt because of my thread... Just the thought
of it gives me chills!"
"97a00dda","Sorry, I just can't handle the responsibility!"
"8a9dbaec","Calm down!
Nobody's gotten hurt yet!"
"8b9dbc5f","Oh! Yeah, you're right... Okay, deep breaths..."
"8c9dbe32","Right, I'm okay now... Sorry, before I knew it I had a panic
attack..."
"8d9dbfa5","Yeah.. the lifeline thing's too scary for me. Let's think of
something else..."
"869db4a0","Something that is KIND of helpful... I wonder..."
"879db613","Fishing line! What a great idea! Even I could make something
like that."
"889db786","Wait... I don't have anything I could use as a fishing rod.
Hey, could you help me find a stick or something?"
"899db979","Sure!
I guess...
No dice."
"929dc744","Really?! Wow, thanks so much!"
"939dc937","Heh heh, sorry. And thanks!"
"9ca492c7","Don't say that! C'mon, be a pal!"
"9ba49154","Okay, if you find anything that could be used as a rod,
bring it here! I'm counting on you!"
"e9d62ba1","If you find anything that could be used as a rod, bring it
here! I'm counting on you!"

"c30d1d8d","Yep, here it is!
Not yet..."
"c20d1c1a","Oooh, that's the ticket! Okay, now I just tie the string to
the end..."
"bd0d147b","Presto, fishing rod complete! Couldn't have done it without
you! Here's a little something to say thanks."
"bc0d1288","I hope this helps with your fishing! Use it well!"

Fruit!"

packed, ain't it?"

greed, you know!"
"255ca597","Wait, don't tell me you're one of those ""pocket full of

have something good to tell ya!"
"b4d1f4ba","A human Tamer, are you? Collecting ingredients?"
"b4d1f4bb","Each Digimon has their own favorite ingredient. The more you
have on hand, the more Digimon friends you can satisfy."
"b4d1f4b8","Now if you'll excuse me, I'm quite busy with training.
Until we meet again..."
"b5d1f62d","Oh... Lord Taomon..."
"b2d1f154","I was almost ready to serve you the ultimate dish..."
"b3d1f2c7","What's wrong?
Lord Taomon?"
"b0d1ee0e","Oh, I didn't expect to see a human here... What a rare
sight..."
"b1d1efe1","No, perhaps this is fate... I have a request to ask of you,
noble human."
"aed1eb28","You know Lord Taomon?! What a stroke of good fortune."
"afd1ec9b","I have a request for you, dear human... Will you heed it?"
"acd1e7c2","My name is Renamon. I was Lord Taomon's chef."
"add1e9b5","I was to cook a meal that would make Lord Taomon's tongue
sing! I thought up the recipe and sought out ingredients..."
"1ad4d383","...but then Lord Taomon went off somewhere. Still, I refuse
to give up."
"19d4d210","This, the ultimate dish I put my all into...I want my lord
to taste it."
"1cd4d6e9","That's when it hit me. If I threw a banquet here, my lord
would surely appear!"
"1bd4d576","So I resumed my search for ingredients, but one still eludes
me, I'm afraid..."
"1ed4d9cf","The ingredient I still need is called a Digicarp."
"1dd4d85c","You're the only one I can ask... Please do something to help
this poor servant."
"20d4dd15","Help you I shall!
Um, now's a bad time..."
"1fd4dba2","Truly? You have my thanks, kind human."
"22d4e07b","Well then, please catch a Digicarp. I leave the matter in
your care."
"21d4de88","It needs to be fresh, so please, do hurry back with it."
"a8cd6448","Oh, are you busy at the moment? Well then, whenever you are
able..."
"a9cd663b","Do save this humble servant, somehow..."
"86611ece","Oh... Lord Taomon..."
"85611d5b","What did I need to catch?
Please wait a bit longer."
"84611be8","A Digicarp... That is what I need to complete my dish."
"8b6126ed","Yes, I shall wait. Please bring a Digicarp for my recipe."
"2eedc6bb","Oh... Lord Taomon..."
"2fedc82e","What did I need to catch?
Please wait a bit.
Here, I brought you a Digicarp!"
"30edc981","A Digicarp... That is what I need to complete my dish."
"31edcb74","Yes, I shall wait. Please bring a Digicarp for my recipe."
"32edcce7","Oh, my! You've brought it! Oh kind human, I thank you from
the bottom of my heart."
"32edcce6","You handed over one Digicarp!"
"33edce5a","Yes! Now I can make the ultimate dish!"
"34edcfcd","Lord Taomon will surely be pleased! If I hurry, I can hold
my banquet tonight!"
"25edb850","Renamon joined the city!"
"7f8dac9e","Man, I'm so hungry... What can I say, I'm a gourmand!"

"77393f7d","Bloop...ugh...!!! Man... I was so full that my movements
were sluggish!"

city, so please forgive me..."

No way!"
"3270020f","Bloop bloop... F-food..."
"3170009c","Bloop bloop...

"aab39e86","What is this...? Are you a human?!"
"abb3a079","What are you doing in a place like this? Oh I see... Is this
your first time here?"
"a8b39ba0","This is Server Desert...a place devoid of vegetation after
intense heat from old servers withered all the plants away."
"a9b39d13","The old break room called Oasis has a vending machine and a
toilet. I hear a tower of new-type servers lies deep within."
"b6b3b1aa","Head out west a ways to reach Ohguino Wastelands. South of
here lies another area called Logic Volcano."
"b7b3b31d","But beware, the Digimon out there are stronger than the ones
you'll face in Nigh Plains."
"cd463906","Uuurgh! That blockhead Togemon!"
"cc463793","Hey, listen! That Togemon is awful! Togemon made fun of my
special move!"
"cb463620","The nerve, saying, ""Your special move lacks something!""
My Veemon Headbutt is perfect, I tells ya!"
"d2464125","What an awful thing to say, right?!"
"d1463fb2","Make up, won't you?
Welp, what can you do?
Togemon says you should come back!"
"d0463ddf","Yer telling me to take the high road?! No way, Jose!
Not a chance!"
"cf463c6c","I won't go back until Togemon apologizes like a good 'mon!"
"d6464751","You making fun of me too?! Hmph! I got nothing else to say
to you! G'wan, get outta here!"

"49432ae3","""I want Veemon to get stronger."" Togemon said that?"
"4a432c56","But I got mad and stormed off... I can't just go back like
this, it's lame..."
"4b432dc9","Gimme some time... I'll go back after I get stronger.
Still, just how'm I supposed to do that...?"
"4c432fbc","You're training isn't complete yet?
If you need a training partner, I'll fight with you!"
"4d43312f","That's right! Okay, I'll try hard on my own fer a bit!"

will ya?! Thanks, bud!"
"dc9ab1ac","Veemon joined the city!"
"d352bfa8","Veemon, where did you go?"
"d652c461","Veemon learned a new move. But it still has lots of flaws,
so it's incomplete. It lacks something."
"d552c28e","...I want Veemon to get stronger, so I said ""that move lacks
something,"" you know."
"d852c747","Then that 'mon just got mad and ran off! ...I must have been
too harsh."
"d752c5d4","Veemon's gotten stronger, but it's still a child. I'm
worried..."
"da52caad","Should I go look for Veemon?
That's a real worry, for sure."

"cc52b4a3","...Then please, it's up to you. You must bring Veemon back!"
"cb52b330","Yeah, it IS a worry--wait, you making fun of me?! Just get
outta here, then!"
"c9702303","Veemon... I'm so worried..."

I found Veemon."

"c0de82d5","...Oh! Thank you! I see... Veemon DID say it was time for
more training..."
"bfde8162","But...even though Veemon's a greenhorn, you still won?
You've got talent!"
"bede7f8f","I want to see it for myself... Let's fight!"
"bdde7e1c","Now's not a good time.
You want a fight, you got it!"
"c4de8901","Alright, then I'll wait here! Come on back when you're in
the mood!"
"c3de87ae","Right answer! ...Okay, let's do it!"
"a0bb72f9","Hmm...you move well! All of you are pretty strong!"
"9dbb6e20","If I train I'll get stronger and stronger! I'll be waiting
in the city's training gym!"
"9ebb6f93","Togemon joined the city!"
"fa316457","*cough* *cough* Hey, you there, got a second?"
"fb3165ca","?"
"fc3167bd","As you can see, I've got a cough... *cough* It just won't go
away, and I feel weak... *cough*"
"f5315cb8","This illness comes from a lack of flame energy in my body...
I can't shoot a Mega Flame, either... *cough*... Ugh."
"f6315e2b","M-Medicine won't work, I need to charge my flame energy.
I need you to get me a Magma Lozenge! *cough*"
"f7315f9e","I don't have the strength to get it myself... *cough cough*
I won't last long like this...so please! *cough*"
"f8316171","I'll get it, no problem!
I hope it's not contagious..."
"f131560c","Oh! Really, you'll do that for me? *cough* I owe you one!"
"f23157ff","Magma Lozenges are clumps of volcanic energy... There should
be some around Logic Volcano! *cough*"
"ff33aaed","Yeah, I guess you're right... I don't want to give it to
you... *cough*"
"374c4f3c","Magma Lozenges should fall somewhere around Logic Volcano!
*cough*"
"3a4c53f5","""Please, before my illness gets any worse... You're a
lifesaver! *cough*"
"b6fa6809","You got a Magma Lozenge!"
"322c2186","Oh, that's it! You got me a Magma Lozenge!"
"312c2013","You handed over the Magma Lozenge!"
"302c1ea0","This should do the trick... *cough* Better take it now!"
"372c29a5","*gulp* ...Oh! Whoaaaaa!!! My body's brimming over with flame
energy!"
"362c2832","Great, I'm all better now! Now I can shoot all the Mega
Flames I want!"
"352c265f","Wow, you really saved my bacon! I have to do something to
thank you..."
"342c24ec","I have a special talent, you know. I'll unleash it in the
city!"
"ad2911f0","Greymon joined the city!"
"93fc036","Yo yo yo! The name's Gargomon! You're a human, ain'tcha?"
"93fc037","I never thought I'd meet a human in a hot spot like this!
It's dangerous to be around me, so keep your distance!"
"a3fc1a9","Yo yo yo! The name's Gargomon! You're a human, ain'tcha?"
"73fbcd0","Never thought I'd meet one of you in this desert! What
brings you here, anyway?"
"83fbe43","Gimme some Cyber Grease!
Nothing, actually."
"d3fc662","Truth be told, I've got some Cyber Grease on me. But what
are you gonna use it for?"
"e3fc7d5","I mean, a human like you wouldn't need it, right?"
"b3fc31c","This stuff's for Digimon, see. You can't use it to fry up
some greasy eats, know what I'm sayin'?"
"c3fc48f","Me, I use it for repairs on my Gatling arm. I need the stuff
so I can't just be giving it away."
"113fccae","(You talked about GrapLeomon.)"
"123fce01","Uh oh, GrapLeomon's in a bind?! We're brothers in arms--
spinning arms, to be exact!"
"f42083f","In a desert like this, getting sand into that turbine is the
worst!"
"e42064c","If I'm not careful, sand gets into my Gatling arm real quick
and messes it up."
"11420b05","So why am I in a desert like this, you ask? Well look at all
this wide, open space!"
"10420992","I can shoot off my Gatling gun 24/7! This is the life!"
"b4201f3","But enough of that, my bud's in trouble! I gotta help! Here,
take this."
"a420000","You got the Cyber Grease!"
"d4204d9","For someone with stationary arms, you're not bad! Let's be
friends, too!"
"c420366","Gargomon joined the city!"
"17421497","Is that right? Then no problem!"
"5009000a","Yo yo yo! The name's Gargomon! You're a human, ain'tcha?"
"4f08fe97","Never thought I'd meet one of you in this desert! What
brings you here, anyway?"
"4e08fd24","Gimme some Cyber Grease!
Nothing, actually."
"4d08fbb1","Truth be told, I've got some Cyber Grease on me. But what
are you gonna use it for?"
"4c08f9de","Hey, you don't have any room for this in your inventory!"
"4b08f86b","I can't do anything if you're full up, man!"
"4a08f6f8","Is that right? Then no problem!"
"f717a9f","Hmm...you're a human, are you? They call me GrapLeomon.
I'm currently undergoing training here."
"f717a9e","Sorry, but I don't have time to shoot the breeze with you.
I'm sure you've got something to take care of yourself!"
"e71792c","Hey you! Come help me out over here!"
"11717de5","?"
"10717c72","The truth is, my brother Leomon is fighting a tough battle
in Ohguino Wastelands beyond this sand wall..."
"b717453","I want to destroy this wall and go help at once, but the
turbines on my arms got sand in them and broke down..."
"a7172e0","I can't use my special moves like this! That's why I need
your help..."
"d7177b9","Gargomon has the Cyber Grease I need to fix my turbines.
Could you get it for me?!"
"c7175c6","You got it!
I can't right now."
"17718777","Great, that'd really help me out!"
"16718584","Gargomon should be around here in the Server Desert
somewhere! Thanks again!"
"896e6916","I see... Well, if you come back through here, I'll ask you
again! Please, do come back!"
"46460087","Please go get the Cyber Grease I need to fix my arm turbines
from Gargomon!"
"4746027a","Gargomon should be here in the Server Desert! I beg of you!"
"1c7cee1a","I have awaited your return! I see you've brought the Cyber
Grease I need!"
"1b7ceca7","You handed over the Cyber Grease!"
"1a7ceb34","Okay... Time for me to fix my turbines! First brush sand out
of the rotator, then apply Cyber Grease to the bearings..."
"197ce941","Now turn in slowly, letting it seep in... Great! Repairs
complete!"
"187ce7ee","As for this sand wall... I'll destroy it with all my power!
Special move...the King of Fists!!!"
"177ce67b","Whew... Now I can finally go help Leomon. ...Ugh, what
the--?!"
"167ce488","Oh no! It looks like my repairs weren't finished..."
"157ce315","My turbines are all scorched from using my special move...
I don't think I can go on like this..."
"147ce1a2","...Oh, I know! Could you go instead?"
"177aa784","Please, go to Ohguino Wastelands and help Leomon for me!"
"187aa977","I'll go for you!
That's a bit much..."
"197aaaea","You have my thanks! I apologize for all these requests, but
your strength is needed!"
"1a7aac5d","But I have no one else to ask! I need you to do it!"
"137aa158","Lastly, let me teach you the motto Leomon and I share..."
"147aa2cb","If you say it, Leomon will know you're there in my place,
and will trust you for sure! Our motto is..."
"157aa4be","""No Meat, No Digi-Life!"""
"167aa611","Words left behind by a wise carnivore, they say..."
"f7a9b2c","...?"
"107a9c9f","Anyway, I'm counting on you to help Leomon! I'll return the
favor in your city!"
"898216df","GrapLeomon joined the city!"
"89f6372e","Hey punk! Whaddaya think you're doing, busting in on my turf
without permission?!"
"8af63881","?!"
"8bf63a74","All things here belong to me, Garudamon! If you want to take
that...it means you're ready to face the music, right?!"
"8cf63be7","I'm sorry!!!
Whatever falls here belongs to everybody!"
"8df63d5a","As long as you understand, I'll let you off the hook this
time!"
"8ef63ecd","But don't think there'll be a second time... Remember, this
turf belongs to me..."
"7ff62750","Grr... You're just a punk that doesn't listen to reason.
Guess that means you're after my turf!"
"80f628c3","Know your place, punk...or I'll be the one to teach it to
you!"
"a61f07c0","Hey punk... I told you this is my turf, didn't I? What the
heck do you want?!"
"a91f0c99","Nothing, nothing at all!
You can't have it all to yourself!"
"a81f0b26","Hmph... In that case, get lost. This is my turf, and mine
alone..."
"ab1f0fff","You're just a punk that doesn't listen to reason.
Guess that means you're just after my turf!"
"aa1f0e0c","Know your place, punk...or I'll be the one to teach it to
you!"
"fda652d","What in the... I...I lost...?"
"cda6054","I...I guess you might be right. Maybe this place doesn't
belong to anybody..."
"dda61c7","All right, I'll open up my turf...but don't think I trust
you completely, punk."
"ada5d0e","I'm gonna stick around for a bit..."
"bda5ee1","I'll see with my own eyes whether or not you're fit to use
this place!"
"7afacd12","Think of all the things you gather here as treasure, and use
them wisely!"
"79facbbf","That's what someone fit to use this place would do..."
"8055fb9f","Today we gotta talk, punk. I've been watching you this whole
time, see?"
"8155fd72","Watching to see how you'd use the things you get here...
whether you're fit to use this place..."
"8255fee5","Truth is, you've been going about it the right way. The way
the city's developing is proof of that."
"7b55f3e0","I've got to hand to it you, you're the right person to use
this place...and from now on, you'll be its guardian!"
"7c55f553","That's all I had to say. Now then... What'll I do from now
on, I wonder?"
"7d55f6c6","...Oh yeah, that'd work! I'll move to the city!"
"7e55f8b9","Whaddaya know, I get some good ideas every once in a while!
Looking forward to seeing you again in the city!"
"87560684","Garudamon joined the city!"
"445b3824","What in the... I...I lost...?"
"475b3cfd","I...I guess you might be right. Maybe this place doesn't
belong to anybody..."
"465b3b0a","All right, I'll open up my turf. Now then... What'll I do
from now on, I wonder?"
"415b336b","...Oh yeah, that'd work! I'll move to the city!"
"405b31f8","Whaddaya know, I get some good ideas every once in a while!
Looking forward to seeing you again in the city!"
"435b36b1","Garudamon joined the city!"
"3aa86951","Oh, and who are you? Well, whoever you may be, please leave."
"3aa86950","Or could you be an envoy of the Colosseum, come to fetch me?
...Oh, don't worry if you don't know what I mean."
"39a867fe","It's you... The human that's been making a splash in the
Colosseum lately..."
"38a8660b","I am MirageGaogamon... Once I was known far and wide as a
champion of the city Colosseum..."
"37a86498","I heard whispers in the wind of you, and now I wish to
engage you in combat..."
"3ea86f9d","If you can beat me in 30 seconds, I promise to become your
ally. What do you say?"
"3da86e2a","Cool! Let's fight!
Not right now, thanks..."
"3ca86cb7","Well met, Tamer! Now then, show me that power famed in the
Colosseum!"
"3ba86ac4","...You disappoint me, Tamer. Should you change your mind,
feel free to call on me anytime!"
"bdfa54dd","Have you come to accept my challenge? Allow me to remind
you..."
"bafa5004","Should you defeat me in 30 seconds, I promise to join your
ranks. Now then, shall we battle?"
"a08c6530","...That's all you've got?"
"a38c6989","The Colosseum has certainly gotten soft in my absence!
Back in my day, I daresay you'd never see such weaklings..."
"a28c6816","Still, I believe you have room to grow... Feel free to try
again anytime!"
"7ac3588f","...Hrrm! Splendid!"
"7bc35a62","Such power! Your reputation in the Colosseum was well-
deserved! As promised, we are comrades. To the city I go!"
"7cc35bd5","I'll join the Colosseum again, but not as a fighter... Until
next we meet!"
"75c350d0","MirageGaogamon joined the city!"
"e0ae763e","HUMAN...ARE YOU MASTER TO MACHINEDRAMON?"
"dfae744b","TELL ME, FOR WHAT PURPOSE DID YOU DESTROY THE DOMICILE
I WORKED SO HARD TO CREATE?"
"deae72d8","I KNOW THE TRUTH. A HUMAN MADE MACHINEDRAMON MALFUNCTION."
"e5ae7ddd","I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HUMANS THINK, BUT I WILL MAKE YOU
SUFFER!"
"e4ae7c6a","I think you've got the wrong person?
(Best to just run away from this one...)"
"e3ae7af7","I...CAN'T TELL YOU HUMANS APART. ...ANYWAY! YOU WILL FIGHT
ME, AND YOU WILL PAY!"
"e2ae7904","RUNNING AWAY, ARE YOU? DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET AWAY WITHOUT
PUNISHMENT!"
"6500631d","A HUMAN... I CAN'T TELL YOU HUMANS APART..."
"62005e44","STILL, YOU WILL PAY FOR DESTROYING MY DOMICILE!"
"47927370","...I SEE. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MACHINEDRAMON."
"4a9277c9","MY DOMICILE? I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. I JUST WANTED TO
SAMPLE YOUR STRENGTH, THAT'S ALL."
"49927656","I'LL LEND YOU MY STRENGTH...AND IF I DO, YOU MUST TAKE CARE
OF THAT LYING HUMAN..."
"4c927b2f","GranKuwagamon joined the city!"
"a15e1008","Hmph... This feeling... It's here, too... That dark...
virus..."
"a15e1009","Oh? It's a human... How long have you been standing there?
Pardon me, there's something I must look into."
"a15e100a","I'm right in the middle of it, you see. This, too, is part
of an angel's mission... Now I must ask you to leave."
"a25e11fb","...What did you come to see me for?"
"a35e136e","Ikkakumon wants to eat your food!
Nothing, nothing at all!"
"a45e14c1","Ikkakumon said that? ...I see. ...It's true that I used to
work as a chef, but..."
"a55e16b4","But I quit when faced with my great mission as an angel...
Still, making food is also an important job..."
"a65e1827","Hunger has been a prevalent source of conflict since ancient
times...its satisfaction, the foundation of peace..."
"a75e199a","...Very well! I'll bring my cooking skills to your city!"
"a85e1b0d","This is the advent of my new holy mission! Do pass this news
on to Ikkakumon."
"995e0390","Seraphimon joined the city!"
"9a5e0503","I see..."
"a7605871","If you ever have something to talk about, do come back..."
"ca22934d","Oh, a human! A most fortuitous meeting, indeed."
"c7228ef4","I am Magnamon, of the Royal Knights!"
"c8229067","I was looking for you! Please give me your autograph!
Um, bye!"
"c5228bae","What?! My...autograph? I don't understand..."
"c6228d01","Were you summoned to save this world from peril? Or perhaps
you came to take it over?"
"c3228848","The Royal Knights are always summoned for such magnanimous
events..."
"c4228a3b","Ah, I get it. You were contracted to do something terrible
to me, weren't you! Harrumph! Unforgivable!　"
"c1228562","Bye...? I see, so you're not that human I've been hearing
about lately."
"d27700ee","Wow, how strong you are! My apologies, it appears I was in
error."
"d176ff7b","(You talked about ExVeemon.)"
"d076fd88","Hmm, ExVeemon, you say... Well...if you really need it,
I suppose I'll give you my autograph..."
"d777088d","?!"
"d677071a","...on one condition!"
"d57705a7","Tell this ExVeemon not to fawn over us Royal Knights.
If anything, aim to overthrow us!"
"d4770434","Er, I guess ""overthrow"" is a bit much. Still, one doesn't
get stronger through adoration alone...right?"
"cb76f5e9","You got Magnamon's Autograph!"
"ca76f476","I think I'll head to the city for my original goal. I assume
that's all right with you?"
"cd74ba58","I understood everything about you through our battle.
Royal Knight Magnamon will lend you strength!"
"ce74bbcb","Magnamon joined the city!"
"cf74bdbe","Now then, I suppose I'll go, too...is what I'd like to say."
"d074bf11","But the truth is, even using the armor of miracles, the seal
on my revival has yet to be lifted completely."
"d174c084","Unfortunately, it seems a powerful barrier has been erected,
one that even envelops dimensional power."
"d274c277","Once this world's purification function is reset... and the
dimensional power returns to normal...please return then?"
"d374c3ea","Until next time. I look forward to the day we meet again!"
"3f7c2993","Why hello there, stranger! It seems you've finally done it!"
"3e7c2820","As promised, I shall go to the city. The Royal Knight
Magnamon shall lend you his strength!"
"fc40135b","Oh, a human! A most fortuitous meeting, indeed."
"fd4014ce","I am Magnamon, of the Royal Knights!"
"fe4016a1","I was looking for you! Please give me your autograph!
Um, bye!"
"ff401814","What?! My...autograph? I don't understand..."
"401987","But still, before you ask for something, shouldn't you have
some space to hold it first?"
"1401b7a","""Don't underestimate the importance of an open inventory.""
That's what they teach us in the Royal Knights! ...Probably."
"2401ced","Bye...? I see, so you're not that human I've been hearing
about lately."
"68329e82","I finally found you, {0}! It is I, Leopardmon
of the Royal Knights!"
"67329d2f","Are you to become panacea or poison for this world?
This, I came to ascertain for myself!"
"66329bbc","You seem like an excellent Tamer...but that is why!
Exactly why! You could become a threat to all Digimon."
"653299c9","If you insist on living among us Digimon, then fight me.
Through battle, prove that you have what it takes!"
"64329856","Let's do it!
I don't think I can right now..."
"633296e3","Now I shall ascertain your true power!"
"62329570","If you fight with confusion in your heart, I cannot see your
true power... I'll wait for your challenge, Tamer!"
"f002e541","Oh {0}, has your uncertainty passed?
If so, I'll say it once more..."
"ed02e088","If you insist on living among us Digimon, then fight me.
Fight me, and prove you have what it takes!"
"d2df63d4","How wonderful, {0}! I acknowledge you..."
"d5df68ad","Surely you have what it takes to live alongside Digimon..."
"d4df673a","...and for me to offer my assistance! When next we meet,
this power is at your command."
"cfdf5f1b","Leopardmon joined the city!"
"3fabd9ec","Bored bored booored...maybe I should head back... Hmm, on
second thought..."
"3fabd9ed","Whoa! Who the heck're you?! D-Don't tell me you heard that
just now? It's nothing, nothing I tell ya!"
"3fabd9ee","Huh? You wanna know about Logic Volcano?"
"3fabd9ef","What ya see is what ya get--a blazing mountain with rivers
of flame. A bad place for Digimon that can't take the heat!"
"3fabd9e8","Not many people come around these parts, so the Taomon sect
has set up base further on in."
"3fabd9e9","I also hear there's plenty of Legendary Digimon lying in
wait, from warriors to dragons!"
"3fabd9ea","Listen, buddy, if you're having any doubts about your
strength, you'd better not venture too far in."
"40abdb5f","Wait, am I getting ahead of myself? You got something you
wanna say to me first?"
"41abdd32","Zudomon says sorry!
Nah, I got nothing to say to you..."
"42abdea5","Eh, my master said that?! ...Even though it was my bad...
Y'see, the other day he made me a fat stack of pancakes..."
"3babd3a0","I suggested using my tail instead of a griddle... ""Don't use
your work tools to cook, dummy!"" he says."
"3cabd513","I got pissed at the time, but my master was right, y'know?
A Digimon's only weapon in battle is its body."
"3dabd686","I wonder if he still thinks of me as his pupil? All right,
I'll go to the city and wait for him to show up!"
"3eabd879","Gumdramon joined the city!"
"47abe644","What'd you wanna talk about?! You just killin' time or what?"
"48abe837","Me?! Nah man, I ain't no slacker like you!"
"57ec2f07","Unngh... Where are all the tough guys...? Where you at?!"
"57ec2f06","Huh? Who're you? ...Oh, f-forget what you heard just now!"
"56ec2d94","Say, you got a bit of a reputation, yeah? Word on the street
is you're pretty strong!"
"59ec326d","Having trouble finding someone to help hone that strength?
I can help you out, if ya want!"
"58ec30fa","My special rubber armor gets harder with each fight, and
soon it'll look real nice!"
"53ec28db","That's why I wanna fight some more. All you can get
stronger, too, it's a win-win!"
"52ec2768","Cool! Let's throw down!
I'm not gonna fight now."
"55ec2c21","Yo, that's what I'm talking about! Let's get to it!"
"54ec2a4e","A'ight, I did just ask outta the blue kinda... Whenever
you're ready, you know where to find me!"
"92e6f10f","Good to go? I'm ready to take you on anytime!"
"93e6f2e2","All right, here I come!"
"ec3f6842","Oh wow, I can see it now! You're a tough bunch, that's for
sure."
"eb3f66ef","If I didn't have this special rubber armor I wouldn't be
able to move. Even my armor seems happy right now!"
"ea3f657c","Hey, wanna do this again sometime? I'll go to the city, so
let's make it a weekly thing! Later!"
"e93f6389","Arresterdramon joined the city!"
"613e23e","La la laaa...hmm, nope, that's not it..."
"613e23f","Laaa la la laaa...naw, still not right...hey pal, don't
interrupt the artistic process, all right?"
"713e391","Hey, you! Lately everyone and their granny-mon is talking
about some human, that you?!"
"413ded8","Hmm...say, are you the type that's into music? You give off
that vibe, y'know..."
"513e04b","I mean, everyone's got their tastes, but I get the feeling
you and I are on the same wavelength!"
"a13e86a","What's your key, F minor? ... No wait, E major...
...Maybe B flat minor?!"
"b13e9dd","Actually I used to be in a band! You can tell?
Sorry...I don't know the first thing about music."
"813e504","That's right! Boy, I knew it! How about we duel in a
harmonious duet?!"
"913e6f7","And here I thought you'd pick up what I was putting down..."
"a0369552","Oh hey, it's you again! I knew it, you've got a thing for
music, don't ya?"
"9f3693ff","We're on the same wavelength, I can tell... Ohhh, I see...
It was A major all along, right?!"
"a591c3df","Hahaha, what an awesome jam session! Our harmony shook me to
the Digi-bone!"
"a691c5b2","...Okay, I've decided! I'm gonna go to the city and set up
a place just for you!"
"a791c725","The Digital World will be groovin' to our tunes, man!"
"a091bc20","OmegaShoutmon joined the city!"
"b6b3dcf3","What do you want? This one does not know you."
"b7b3de66","Someone told you to come here? Hmph, no one comes to mind."
"b8b3dfd9","Give back the Myobrella you stole!
...Or maybe not."
"b9b3e14c","""Myobrella""? This one has not heard of such a thing."
"bab3e33f","Nor has this one met a Myotismon..."
"bbb3e492","...Oh! Uhhhh... Wait, forget this one said anything."
"bcb3e605","It was a slip of the tongue, this one knows not of such a Digimon!
If you would doubt this one, fight and find out for yourself!"
"bdb3e7f8","If you have no business for this one, be on your way."
"d98a95d8","Aaaaugh! This one was defeated so readily...!"
"dc8a9a91","Hmph... Very well, this one admits it. You have indeed found
your thief."
"db8a993e","You see, this one is actually a treasure hunter. Sometimes
such hunting includes pilfering a wealthy 'mon's treasure."
"de8a9df7","This one did not realize how much value the object in
question held to its original owner."
"dd8a9c04","Look, is it not simply a jet-black umbrella? As such, it
would fetch a paltry sum at the market."
"e08aa0dd","Well, one 'mon's trash is another 'mon's treasure..."
"df8a9f6a","Oh, it is to protect against the harmful rays of the sun?
But Myotismon looked fine to this one... perhaps it's for fashion?"
"d18a8960","At any rate, this one will return what was stolen."
"548785c2","You retrieved the Myobrella!"
"558787b5","Apologies, this one seeks no profit, but a treasure hunter's
skills dull without use..."
"528782fc","Hmm, perhaps this one can do something in Floatia...
Let us see what opportunities await."
"50877f96","Turuiemon joined the city!"
"55ba5545","What do you want? This one does not know you."
"52ba508c","Someone told you to come here? Hmph, no one comes to mind."
"53ba527f","Give back the Myobrella you stole!
I think I got the wrong person."
"50ba4da6","""Myobrella""? This one has not heard of such a thing."
"51ba4f19","But before that, one should not start such talk with a full
inventory, Tamer."
"4eba4a40","This one knows nothing of items stolen by nefarious Digimon.
That matter is left to you."
"4fba4c33","If you have no business for this one, be on your way."
"49c6270a","I can't make any headway in my training with all these
injuries...I'll just have to endure it for now..."
"49c6270b","Ow-ow-owww... *sigh*"
"49c62708","...Oh, who're you? Sorry, but I'm busy at the moment...
Please go away."
"4ac628fd","...Hmm? Hey, what's your deal?!"
"47c62424","(You talked about Angemon.)"
"48c62597","What, Angemon? That Digimon is still trying to capture me?!"
"45c620de","Don't think I'll be fooled by talk of you checking out my
wounds!"
"46c622b1","(Gotta fight, huh...)
(I'll retreat for now...)"
"43c61df8","If you won't skedaddle, I'll show you what I'm made of!"
"44c61f6b","Ow-ow-ow... You won't fool me!"
"531a961e","*tsk* You again?! You're a stubborn one, ain't ya?"
"521a94ab","If you're gonna be Angemon's lapdog, then come at me!"
"e51145cb","Ouchie-wah-wah... Aw man... Angemon's gonna dissect me
for sure..."
"e61147be","...Huh? I wont be dissected? But isn't that what medicine's
all about?"
"e7114911","It's not?! Boy, I must've checked out the wrong wiki...
Tell Angemon I said sorry, 'kay? Peace out!"
"e8114a84","Hackmon joined the city!"
"7b27bc00","I am Birdramon... I was commanded to guard this gate by Lord
Taomon."
"7e27c0d9","You... You are not from this world, are you? Begone at once,
interloper!"
"31bfd8fb","I am Birdramon... I was commanded to guard this gate by Lord
Taomon."
"32bfda6e","You... You are not from this world, are you? Begone at once,
interloper!"
"33bfdbc1","I'll turn back for now...
Jijimon asked me to, you know!"
"34bfddb4","Then go... I have no desire to chase down any who withdraw."
"35bfdf27","What? Is this true? ...No, for all I know you're just
dropping Jijimon's name!"
"36bfe09a","If you truly want to pass, then fell me in combat! Only then
I will trust in your words!"
"37bfe20d","I'll turn back for now...
Just remember, you asked for it!"
"28bfca90","Very well, let us begin!"
"29bfcc03","Hmph, scared, are you? The sooner you disappear, the better!"
"8933310e","Ugh... It seems your words ring true, stranger..."
"88332f9b","As the defeated, I have lost the right to guard this gate...
As promised, you may pass."
"87332e28","I am not the only guardian...but perhaps if it's you...
For now, I will return to Floatia with haste."
"8e33392d","Birdramon joined the city!"
"921149ab","...Who the heck are you?"
"93114b1e","I am Meramon! I endeavor to guard this gate at the behest
of our leader, Lord Taomon."
"94114cf1","Beyond this gate is Lord Taomon's territory... I cannot
simply allow some nobody to pass through."
"95114e64","If you wish to pass, then you must defeat me first!"
"96114fd7","You're going down!
I'm not ready yet..."
"9711514a","Ho ho! You think you can beat me?! I'll burn that confidence
right to the ground!"
"9811533d","I see...going at it half-cocked will barely light a fire
under us... I look forward to fighting you. I'll wait here!"
"c41c7030","You're back! Does that mean you're in tip-top shape?!"
"e18a5fdd","I see... That passion, that strength that doesn't lose out
to my flame... You are qualified to meet Lord Taomon..."
"de8a5b04","Very well... I'll let you pass!"
"df8a5cf7","Still, beyond this point awaits an even stronger gatekeeper!
You'd better not let your guard down!"
"dc8a583e","Meramon joined the city!"
"b02aeae","...You are the human that wants to meet Lord Taomon, yes?
You are something else, to have defeated Meramon."
"a02ad3b","Yet those who rely solely on strength cannot meet our lord."
"902ab48","No, that requires intelligence that matches such strength.
Only those who possess both may qualify!"
"1002b64d","First, I will measure that intelligence... I challenge you
to a battle of wits..."
"f02b4da","?!"
"e02b367","Heh heh...shocked? This clone technique is my pride and
joy... With two of these clones, I'll test you right here!"
"d02b1f4","...Now, allow me to explain the rules. First, each of us
three will ask a question..."
"402a3a9","Of these, only the real one will ask a question whose answer
is 9."
"302a236","If you figure out which problem's answer is 9 and discover
the real me, the clones disappear, and you fight me alone."
"6006818","However, if you were to be tricked by a false question whose
answer isn't 9, and you mistake the clone for me..."
"700698b","You will be forced to fight me AND the clones...all three of
us! Now then, show me your stuff!"
"2ae410d","Now then, here is a question."
"ffae3cb4","The following numbers follow a special rule. What is the X?
""2  3  5  7  X  13"""
"ae3e27","If X is 9, then this is the real me. If not...a clone."
"fdae396e","What is your answer?"
"feae3ac1","The answer isn't nine! You're a clone!
The answer is nine! It IS the real you!"
"fbae3608","...In that case, ask one of the other ones for their question."
"fcae37fb","...Incorrect."
"f9ae3322","According to this rule, the answer for X is 11!"
"faae3495","As promised, you will fight all three of us!"
"3a7b92a0","Now then, here is a question."
"3d7b9779","X sheets to the wind. Two's company, X's a crowd. X strikes
and you're out. What do you get if you add up all the Xs?"
"3c7b9586","If X is 9, then this is the real me. If not...a clone."
"3f7b9a5f","What is your answer?"
"3e7b98ec","The answer isn't nine! You're a clone!
The answer is nine! It IS the real you!"
"417b9da5","...In that case, ask one of the other ones for their question."
"407b9c32","Splendid! You are correct!"
"437ba08b","All of these sayings have three in them...so when you add
them up, they equal nine!"
"427b9f18","As promised, my clones are no more...and I alone remain,
to engage you in battle!"
"410ddb7f","Now then, here is a question."
"420ddcd2","June is the 6th month, July is the 7th month, August is the 8th
month...and November is the Xth month."
"430dde45","If X is 9, then this is the real me. If not...a clone."
"3c0dd340","What is your answer?"
"3d0dd533","The answer isn't nine! You're a clone!
The answer is nine! It IS the real you!"
"3e0dd6a6","...In that case, ask one of the other ones for their question."
"3f0dd819","...Incorrect."
"480de664","November is the eleventh month of the year, so the answer
for X is 11!"
"490de7d7","As promised, you will fight all three of us!"
"26b414f2","I...I can't believe I lost..."
"25b4131f","Still, proper decision-making in the heat of battle relies
on one's intelligence..."
"24b411ac","I acknowledge both your intelligence and your strength!
You are worthy of meeting Lord Taomon!"
"23b41039","...Even so, to think I would lose this easily... I cannot
show my face to our lord..."
"d9026377","It's you! You really came!"
"d9026376","As you know, I am Susanomon. Thanks to your efforts, I was
able to revive here."
"d9026375","Still, something unfortunate has occurred...at the same time
as my revival, a fearsome creature was resurrected."
"d9026374","I apologize for asking so much, but...would you lend me your
aid?"
"db02665d","I'm listening!
I refuse!"
"da0264ea","Thank you, kind one! It is a race against time. I need you
to stop that rampaging Digimon..."
"d5025ccb","That Digimon is Examon...one of the Royal Knights!"
"d4025b58","I don't know why, but this Digimon is running wild. If I was
at full power, I could put up a fight..."
"d7026011","...but I have just awoken, and it seems that foe is somehow
preventing me from replenishing my energy."
"d6025ebe","Examon should also be one of this world's protectors...
Well, whatever the reason...I need you to stop this rampage!"
"d102569f","Ugh...but you're the only one I can ask...!"
"20a2b67f","Examon is running wild here on Logic Volcano. Right around
the Flame Lands."
"21a2b7d2","If Examon leaves the mountain, who knows what'll happen?!
Please...stop this no matter the cost!"
"648eff2","You stopped Examon's rampage! We barely made it, huh. Still,
I wonder what was the cause of all that?"
"548ee1f","What...a fishbone...? Ha ha ha! Who would've thought?!"
"448ecac","If it ever happens again, I'll be that knight's opponent.
I'll think of it as a bit of exercise!"
"348eb39","Susanomon joined the city!"
"91b4509c","WarGreymon is here!!!"
"91b4509d","But it's not responding... It's like there's no soul inside
of it..."
"92b4520f","Hey, long time no see, {0}!"
"93b453e2","Oh, sorry if I freaked you out. Think of it as a bad joke."
"94b45555","I heard you used to be Tamer to a WarGreymon like me..."
"8db44a50","Now it's {1}, huh... I see.
Hey, won't you show me how strong you've gotten?"
"8eb44bc3","Alright, let's go!
Let me get ready..."
"8fb44db6","Okay, show me that power at once!"
"90b44f29","I see... Well do come back when you're ready!"
"56b98e94","You came back, {0}!
You're ready to fight with me?"
"59b9936d","Now! Show me {1}'s current power!"
"73dd1001","You're stronger than I imagined! For some reason that makes
me happy..."
"70dd0b48","It's just like when I was your partner, {0}..."
"71dd0d3b","Thank you, for even this can be called friendship. I would
like to join your comrades in the city. See you later!"
"76dd14da","WarGreymon joined the city!"
"a26308e5","Not yet... It's still too early for you."
"a26308e4","Hmph... Come back when you've steeled your resolve!"
"a1630772","Hey, you! Yeah, you!"
"a063059f","That's a good look you've got there! You look like a real
veteran!"
"9f63042c","The name's BanchoLeomon! Fighting against strong opponents
is my way of life!"
"9e6302b9","Whaddaya say? You wanna trade some blows without saying
anything?"
"9d6300c6","Let's do it!
I can't right now!"
"9c62ff53","Such unwavering spirit, even faced with me! I bet we can
have a good fight!"
"9b62fde0","What?! Don't tell me you're scared? If not, please face me
next time we meet!"
"fb9931b1","You came back! I'll take you on this time..."
"f8992cf8","Fist to fist, as much as we want!"
"731c7904","Ha ha ha ha ha!
How refreshing!"
"761c7ddd","You're as good as I thought! What a spirited fight!
Interacting with our fists! Now we are true friends!"
"751c7c6a","As thanks for this fight, I will head to the city! See you
again, friend!"
"701c744b","BanchoLeomon joined the city!"
"33033418","So you're {0}..."
"360338d1","I see... You have this look only someone who saved the world
could have..."
"3503377e","Show that power to Omegamon, the one who governs the end..."
"38033c37","...and to Alphamon, the one who governs the beginning!"
"37033a44","Let's do it!
I can't right now!"
"3a033f1d","In this battle, our power can end your adventure, or your
power can give rise to a new adventure!"
"39033daa","I see...but we'll be around to fight you anytime!"
"e3ed6a33","You came, {0}!"
"e4ed6ba6","Now then, this time we'll take a look at that power!"
"643f50e6","Wonderful... We hope this power brings forth a new
adventure..."
"633f4f73","The day will surely come when our power will be needed..."
"623f4d80","When the time comes, do not hesitate to call on us... I can
see it, the moment we join forces!"
"693f5885","Omegamon and Alphamon joined the city!"
"2b420420","GWAAAAAR!!!"
"2e4208f9","...Nngh! Hey, you! Did you come to get in my way?!"
"2d420706","My body is being controlled by some unknown rage... I can't
control myself like this."
"30420bdf","Won't you move, human? I don't know what'll happen if you
don't!"
"2f420a6c","I'll do whatever it takes to stop you!
(I'm a little scared, let's back off for now...)"
"32420f25","Th...This anger... G...GWAAAAAR!!!"
"31420db2","Yes, run, human!"
"2592329b","Back, are you?! You can't stop my body filled with anger and
aggression!"
"2692340e","If you insist on staying, knowing this, then all this anger
and aggression will be directed at you!"
"fbc9202e","Hrrm? My anger...this heat...it's disappearing...?
This is...a fish bone...?"
"fac91ebb","I see, this was stuck in my throat...heh...ha ha ha ha!
This must come from the thousand fish I ate for strength."
"f9c91cc8","I'm sorry, human, but thanks to you my body is back to the
way it was. I can help you now!"
"c927cd","Examon joined the city!"
"6b5e0e9d","Ho ho ho...I've found you... {0}, was it?"
"685e09c4","I am Lilithmon, one of the Seven Deadly Digimon. You're the
one who saved this world, aren't you?"
"695e0bb7","I heard the rumor and wondered exactly what you're made of.
But you're such a scrawny runt... Color me unimpressed."
"665e06fe","I can't imagine you'd be able to satisfy me..."
"675e0851","Oh well...I'll let you fight me to kill some time."
"645e0398","...?"
"655e050b","...Jeez, you're thick! Looks like your brains need some
work, too... Fine, I'll make this simple: come fight me!"
"625e00b2","Let's do it!
I can't right now!"
"635e0225","Ho ho, let's dance! It's been a while since I fought...
I won't forgive any negligence on your part!"
"506022f3","How dull. I can't believe how dull you are..."
"e70c21be","You're back, {0}...still as scrawny-looking as
ever, huh. Now, will my words get through to you this time?"
"e60c1fcb","You'd better relieve my boredom, and fight me this time!"
"1be4f86b","Ho ho ho! How enjoyable, {0}! Quite different
from my vulgar battles with the other Deadly Digimon."
"1ce4f9de","You are quite interesting, human... Perhaps I can lend you
a little bit of help."
"1de4fbb1","Unlike the other Seven Deadly Digimon, I can be quite
accommodating... See you soon!"
"1ee4fd24","Lilithmon joined the city!"
"9a99e88b","Hmm, haven't seen your face around. Is this your first time
here?"
"9a99e888","This is Ohguino Wastelands. It's a battleground!"
"9a99e88a","The Meaty Troops and Veggie Troops are waging war here!
You'd better scram if you don't wanna get mixed up in it!"
"8005124e","Oh, you wanna know who I am? I'm Agumon, the 'mon acting as
the Meaty Troops' gatekeeper at Leomon's behest!"
"7f0510db","That's why I can't let any suspicious guys through. And to
be honest, you definitely fit the bill!"
"7e050f68","It'd be awful if you ended up being a spy for the Veggie
Troops! And to make matters worse, we're losing ground!"
"85051a6d","If you want to get past here, you'd better take me on!"
"840518fa","I don't really get it, but let's go!
I'll turn back for now..."
"83051707","You think you can beat me with that weak, veggie-fueled
body?! Face the power of meat, baby!"
"82051594","Leomon told me not to let you through!"
"af75e9ad","You again! It'll be the same no matter how many times you
come here! I'll never let a Veggie Trooper through!"
"ac75e4d4","I'll show you the power of meat! Yaaaargh!"
"45ba8c40","I lost! How could meaty power lose to veggie power?!"
"48ba9119","Wait...you're not with the Veggie Troops? You had no idea
the Meaty Troops and Veggie Troops were fighting each other."
"47ba8fa6","Hey, maybe that strength could help out the Meaty Troops...
Go talk to Leomon! I'm going to the city, so please help us!"
"4aba947f","Agumon joined the city!"
"5b28c4cb","Hey, you...have you seen my sandbag around?"
"5c28c6be","?"
"5d28c811","My name is Gaomon! I'm training sunup to sundown to get
ready for the boxing tournament!"
"5e28c984","But wouldn't you know it, I turn away for one second and my
precious sandbag gets stolen!"
"5f28cb77","...Well I say ""sandbag,"" but it was actually a hunk of meat.
Not surprising, considering the meat shortage around here..."
"6028ccea","But NOW what am I gonna do?! The tournament's around the
corner, and I need a hunk of meat!"
"6128ce5d","Say...could you bring me some hunks of meat? 20 should be
enough for everyone..."
"5228b6e0","Sure!
I have to keep going..."
"5328b853","Thanks a bunch! Please be quick about it, I need them in
time for the boxing tournament!"
"602b0b41","Oh, I see... I didn't realize... C'mon, guys! Which one of
you jerks stole my sandbag?!"
"771462d0","Bring 20 hunks of meat for use as sandbags!"
"7a1467a9","Please hurry, I need them in time for the boxing tournament!"
"c0dda7fd","You brought 20 hunks of meat?!"
"bddda324","Here's 20 hunks of meat!
I can't give them to you right now..."
"bedda497","You handed over 20 Hunks of Meat!"
"bbdd9fde","Ohhh yeahhhh!!! Thank you!!!"
"bcdda1b1","You know, the thing is with these hunks of meat...the more
I punch them, the softer and tastier they get!"
"b9dd9cf8","After an intense workout, I get back my stamina with that
tender meat! Two birds with one stone!"
"badd9e6b","Or at least I did... I've got some bad news.. The truth is,
the boxing tournament's been put on hold..."
"b7dd9992","The conflict between the Meaty Troops and the Veggie Troops
makes a tournament impossible...but I'm not giving up!"
"b8dd9b05","We can hold it once peace has been restored! Until then,
I won't let this meat go to waste!"
"25e08553","Oh, I know! Why don't I go to the city, too? There's
something I wanted to do there. Okay, see you later!"
"27e088b9","Gaomon joined the city!"
"26e086c6","I see...but you better hand some over next time, okay?!"
"931d7fa4","Hey hey hey!!! Hold up there!"
"961d847d","?"
"951d828a","You think you can get through here without permission from
yours truly? You've got some guts, don'tcha?!"
"901d7aeb","...Hmm? You're not from around here, are ya? All right,
lemme teach you a little something!"
"8f1d7978","I'm Goblimon! Everything from here on out is my turf, and
any intruders ain't gonna get off lightly!"
"921d7e31","But I'm not a demon, buddy...despite my looks, heh. I've got
my nice side, too, y'know?"
"911d7c5e","Money talks, but meat talks louder! Bring me 20 rotten
pieces of meat, and I'll let you through!"
"8c1d74bf","I'll bring it!
Never mind, then."
"8b1d72cc","Oh! You're a reasonable guy, aren't ya? Don't forget the 20
pieces of rotten meat."
"8e1b392e","Hmph! In that case, get outta here!"
"cf18431f","If you want past here...you know what to do, right?"
"d01844f2","Bring 20 pieces of rotten meat!"
"c9bd1492","Looks like you brought 20 pieces of rotten meat, huh?"
"c8bd133f","Here you go, 20 pieces of rotten meat!
I can't give them to you right now..."
"c7bd114c","You handed over 20 Rotten Meats!"
"c6bd0fd9","One, two, three...yep, 20 in all!
I got 20 pieces of rotten meat!"
"c5bd0e66","MmmMMM! This beyond-fermented stench! It's so, so inviting!"
"c4bd0cf3","This is some of the best rotten meat I've ever seen...
*sigh* I wonder how I'll cook this exquisite meat?"
"c3bd0b00","...Whoops! I got lost in dreams of rotten meat."
"d2bd22fd","Alright! You can go wherever you want now! I'm going back to
the city for a full-course rotten meat feast!"
"d1bd210a","Goblimon joined the city!"
"c4bace1c","Whoa now...you're looking down on me, aren't ya?! You best
hand over some of that rotten meat next time!"
"b0372fe1","Now hold on a minute! You know who I am, and you're still
trying to do as you please?"
"ad372b28","?"
"ae372c9b","You ain't gonna last long around here with that attitude,
buddy. You gotta go through the proper channels, dig?"
"b33734ba","...You acting like this has nothing to do with you? C'mon,
I ain't ever heard of no Cluelessmon, have you?"
"b437362d","Fine, here's the score! When I say ""proper channels,"" I mean
you gotta give proof of meat to me, boss of this tunnel!"
"b1373154","...What? You don't know what ""proof of meat"" is? That means
you gotta give me 20 of the best pieces of meat."
"b23732c7","Let's cut to the chase--20 Best Meats, bring 'em here!"
"a7372196","Okay, okay, I'll bring some!
What. In the world. Are you talking about?"
"a8372309","Nice! You're a good kid, ya know that? All right, bring me
those 20 Best Meats, PRONTO!"
"353a3ff7","What you say to me?? If you don't get it, then get lost!"
"560105a2","Maybe in time you'll change your mind about that proof of
meat, huh?!"
"550103cf","Don't space out, yo--bring those 20 Best Meats, and fast!"
"fc8ab76f","Looks like you brought 20 Best Meats, huh?"
"fd8ab8c2","20 Best Meats, coming right up!
Not yet..."
"fe8abab5","You handed over 20 Best Meats!"
"f78aafb0","Looks dee-ee-licious! I'm all raring to go! This proof of
meat...I like it, and I'll take it!"
"f88ab123","Feel free to go on ahead through my tunnel! I'm in a great
mood today, so I've got a gift for you!"
"f98ab296","You can be in charge of this tunnel in my stead!"
"fa8ab409","To be honest, all that stuff about ""proof"" and ""Best Meats,""
well...I didn't think you'd actually go through with it!"
"38ac254","Leomon might really blow a fuse at me... Still, I wanna eat
this meat..."
"48ac3c7","...Anyway, I leave this place to you! Later, dude!"
"808dc5f2","Tyrannomon joined the city!"
"7f8dc41f","Whoa now...you don't have any proof of me for me?! You best
hand over that Best Meat next time, you hear me?!"
"34e62485","Huh? Hey! Can't you tell I'm hiding here, pal?!"
"34e62484","If the Veggie Troops find me, they'll gang up on me! G'wan,
get outta here!"
"33e62312","Oh ho...it's you! The newbie that buttered up to Leomon and
started hanging out around here..."
"32e621bf","...Huh? What was that? You want to know where ShineGreymon
is? Don't be ridiculous!"
"31e61fcc","The info I finally got by outwitting my rival Leomon by
giving up the location of the Meaty Troops..."
"30e61e59","You don't expect me to tell Leomon's gofer, do ya?! Or are
you gonna force it outta me?"
"2fe61ce6","Ah well...fine, let's do this!
I give up..."
"2ee61b73","Tch, lookit this tough guy! You think you can beat me?!
You'll regret this!"
"2de61980","Hmph! You'd better shove off, before I toss you outta here!"
"9ac37151","Hey now... It doesn't matter how many times you come over
here."
"97c36c98","I'm not gonna tell a gofer like you where ShineGreymon is!
Or do you plan to force me to tell you?"
"fd468e24","Owww ow ow ow ow! I give, I give! Battle over!!! I'll tell
you ShineGreymon's location..."
"4692fd","Head to the Generator Prison Room...apparently it's being
used as some kind of energy source...?"
"ff46910a","Jeez, I can't believe I told you that info I worked so hard
to get...now I'll never get ahead in the Meaty Troops..."
"fa46896b","You're a tough one, I bet you're full of promise! Alright,
let's get along from here on out!"
"f94687f8","Ogremon joined the city!"
"787dedaf","I am Woodmon...the Digimon in charge of the Generator Prison
Room."
"797def02","...Huh? You want me to give back ShineGreymon? How do you
know about that? ...Wait, exactly how much do you know?!"
"7a7df0f5","Like our plan to fire the Rose Palace laser using solar
power stolen from ShineGreymon..."
"737de5f0","...Like about laying waste to the Meaty Troop Digimon and
Ohguino Wastelands? You know about all that?!"
"747de763","Uh, you just told me everything...you all right?
I'm...gonna pretend I didn't hear that."
"757de8d6","Why, you... Now that you know our secret, here's no way
I can let you leave!"
"767dea49","...Well then get out of here, right now!"
"2ea064b4","It's the shady human... I guess you DO want to stop our plan
to fire a laser powered by ShineGreymon..."
"31a0690d","...Like how we'll shoot a laser using ShineGreymon's solar
power, laying waste to the Meaty Troops and Ohguino?!"
"58697721","Wait a minute... Don't tell me you know about the real
mastermind behind this...?"
"55697268","The one enticing Rosemon to raze the Ohguino Wastelands so
we can develop the land afterwards...?"
"566973db","Bony Resort's Myotis...mon...!"
"5b697bfa","...!"
"5c697d6d","In that case, I can't stay here anymore. Farewell!"
"59697894","Woodmon joined the city!"
"e281e69e","I am Woodmon...the Digimon in charge of the Generator Prison
Room!"
"e181e52b","I cannot let anyone go past here without Lady Rosemon's
permission! Get out of here, right now!"
"ca274138","Hey you! What're you doing here?!"
"cd2745f1","I am Leomon, the leader of the Meaty Troops of the Ohguino
Wastelands."
"cc27441e","I came on behalf of GrapLeomon!
I have nothing to tell you."
"cf2748d7","What? You came on behalf of GrapLeomon! Did something happen
to my friend?!"
"ce274764","({0} explained what had happened.)"
"d1274c3d","I see... So GrapLeomon did all that, just to save me...
But hey, that doesn't mean I trust you yet!"
"d0274a4a","If your story is true, then you must know about our motto...
Go on, tell me what it is!"
"c3273633","""Nice to Meat You!""
""No Meat, No Digi-Life!""
""Say No To Meat Thieves!"""
"c2273440","I think I've heard that phrase before, but...sorry, that's
not the right one."
"c524faa2","This is not the time for jokes. Please go."
"c624fc15","Hmm... Close, but no cigar..."
"c324f75c","You cannot expect me to trust someone who messes up at such
an important time. Please calm yourself and come back again."
"c424f8cf","Ohh! Yeah, that's our motto! Okay, I can trust you, please
help us out in GrapLeomon's place!"
"c124f476","The truth is, us Meaty Troops and Rosemon's Veggie Troops
are clashing here in the Ohguino Wastelands..."
"c224f5e9","In a meat field in the corner of these vast wastelands,
Rosemon erected a structure known as the the Rose Palace..."
"bf24f110","Ever since that day, the Digimon of that area have
experienced a severe food shortage."
"c024f283","What's more, Rosemon's forces formed the Veggie Troops,
and have tried to expel us from these lands!"
"cd25071a","If this continues, all of the Digimon will be in grave
danger! We need your strength to help oppose this outrage!"
"ce25088d","I think you've got the broad strokes of what's going on now.
I know it's out of the blue, but...I have a request for you!"
"bf22b2b9","First, go see for yourself what this area is all about.
If you can, try and get some info out of the Veggie Troops!"
"be22b0c6","This place is full of hot-blooded Digimon... It'll be tough,
but we're counting on you!"
"9dd82353","We need you to understand more about the Ohguino Wastelands.
Try and get some info out of the Veggie Troops!"
"9ed824c6","It'll be tough, but we're counting on you!"
"9183af86","You've learned what's happening in the Ohguino Wastelands!"
"9083ae13","({0} explained everything that's happened.)"
"8f83aca0","Those damn Veggie Troops... I can't believe they're being
so cruel to the other Digimon..."
"9683b7a5","But thanks to your efforts, we know more about what they're
up to...their solidarity is weak! Surely we can prevail!"
"9583b632","That's why I need one more thing from you...our fellow
warrior ShineGreymon is currently missing."
"9483b45f","It sounds like the Veggie Troops have captured that brave
soul, but the location of their prison is unknown..."
"9383b2ec","Meaty Troops commando Ogremon seems to have found some
intel, but the oaf sees me as a rival, and won't tell me."
"9a83bdd1","Please talk to Ogremon, and get him to tell you where
they've taken ShineGreymon!"
"9983bc7e","Ogremon won't fess up easily, but we're counting on you!"
"1651f609","Please learn the location of ShineGreymon's prison from
Ogremon!"
"1351f1b0","Ogremon isn't one to give up without a fight, but we're
counting on you!"
"96a3dd3c","Oh! You've learned where they're keeping ShineGreymon?!"
"99a3e1f5","(You explained what you heard from Ogremon.)"
"98a3e002","What?! ShineGreymon is being held in the Generator Prison
Room, and is being used as some kind of energy source?"
"93a3d863","It's true that a massive amount of solar energy is contained
within ShineGreymon's body..."
"92a3d6f0","But what are those Veggie Troops planning to do with that
energy? Ugh...I have a bad feeling about this!"
"95a3db49","It'll be too late by the time we've figured it out! Please,
go to the Generator Prison Room and rescue ShineGreymon!"
"94a3d9d6","Security should be tight around there...don't take too long,
but make sure you're well-prepared!"
"5988f257","Go to the Generator Prison Room and rescue ShineGreymon!"
"5a88f3ca","Security should be tight around there... Make sure you're
well-prepared!"
"dc1bfe6a","Oh! You succeeded in rescuing ShineGreymon?!"
"db1bfcf7","({0} explained everything that's happened.)"
"da1bfb04","I see... ShineGreymon must have been exhausted..."
"d91bf991","That damn Rosemon! To think they plan to burn down all of
the Ohguino Wastelands with a laser!"
"d81bf83e","We have to stop that plan, no matter what it takes!"
"d71bf64b","But just in case, let's evacuate the Digimon around here!
I'll stay here and direct things!"
"d61bf4d8","Please head to their headquarters in the Rose Palace, and
prevent them from firing that laser!"
"d51bf365","The Ohguino Wastelands, and the lives of all the Digimon who
live here, are counting on you! Good luck!"
"45156dd","I want you to head to the Rose Palace, and prevent Rosemon
from firing that laser!"
"1515204","The Ohguino Wastelands, and the lives of all the Digimon who
live here, are counting on you! Good luck!"
"e6e36730","You stopped Rosemon from firing the laser? That's amazing!"
"e9e36b89","Our long battle is finally over...and peace has once again
returned to this land..."
"e8e36a16","All of this is thanks to your hard work! The Meaty Troops...
no, all of us Digimon in the Ohguino Wastelands thank you!"
"ebe36eef","You are truly the savior of all meat...and our friend!"
"eae36d7c","Now that I think about it, former allies and enemies are
working together in Floatia, aren't they?"
"ede37235","The battle between the Meaty and Veggie Troops was indeed
intense, but in a way it made all of us stronger..."
"ece37042","In that sense, the battle may not have been for nothing...
Yeah...of course I'll come help!"
"efe3751b","Leomon joined the city!"
"3049a202","It's dangerous around these parts... I suppose that means
it's my time to shine."
"3049a203","Um, I'm actually on kind of a secret mission. Do me a favor
and stay out of my way, okay?"
"3149a3f5","Hmm? What do you want with me?"
"2e499f3c","Wizardmon wants you to come back to the city.
Nothing, nothing at all."
"2f49a0af","What, Wizardmon said that? We haven't talked in ages, so
this is a bit out of the blue..."
"2c499bd6","We traveled the world looking for magic ingredients
together, and it was a blast...a bit hairy at times, though."
"2d499d49","Oh! Maybe this is why Wizardmon couldn't contact me!
It's a magic-blocking stone!"
"2a4998f0","Do me a favor and keep this a secret from Wizardmon, yeah?
Alright, off to the city! Later!"
"2b499a63","Garurumon joined the city!"
"3849aefa","Nothing, you say... You sure you're not hiding something?"
"3949b06d","Ah well, maybe I don't want to know..."
"d4dbbe5f","...What's your deal, man? You came to steal the veggies from
these fields?"
"d5dbc032","These are special, man! They grow vegetables eaten by THE
Lady Rosemon!"
"d6dbc1a5","This is no place for a nobody like you to tread, see!"
"cfdbb6a0","Got it? Scram before you get hurt!"
"d0dbb813","Don't go monopolizing veggies!
(Let's head back for now...)"
"d1dbb986","All veggies from these fields are for Lady Rosemon alone! I
got no right to give them to anyone else in the first place!"
"d2dbbb79","Heh! Don't come around these parts again, got it?!"
"6ca1e9e4","Why, you... How many times must I say it? These fields are
special, they grow the veggies eaten by Lady Rosemon!"
"6fa1eebd","It's no place for a suspicious person like you to be!"
"365dde11","...Jeez, alright already! This is ridiculous. I can't take
it anymore!"
"335dd958","I thought monopolizing all these fields and buttering up to
Rosemon would let me live the high life..."
"345ddacb","It ain't worth all this, though! Ah well...maybe I'll see
what's banging in the city, heh!"
"395de2ea","Vegiemon joined the city!"
"8b03f8e","I grow vegetables for Rosemon here! That means they're
S-P-E-C-I-A-L, SPECIAL, got it?!"
"7b03e1b","Grrr, g'wan, get outta here already!"
"fd628375","Oh, are you a newbie recruit for the Veggie Troops?
...Naw, you don't look the part. Too dignified."
"fd628374","This is the Palace of Thorns, castle of Lady Rosemon. Go on,
you can take a look if you're not one of the Meaty Troops."
"fd628377","Lady Rosemon is in the Rose Palace deep within this area."
"fd628376","A few of our numbers are a bit twisted, so I don't know if
you'll make it all the way to Lady Rosemon."
"fd628370","..."
"fc628182","Uuugh...my stomach's sticking to my Digi-ribs, here...
hey you, help a 'mon out..."
"fb62802f","What's wrong?
Sorry, can't right now."
"fa627ebc","Y'see, up till recently I was growing delicious vegetables
in the fields of the Palace of Thorns..."
"f9627cc9","But that jerk Vegiemon has taken control of all the veggie
fields to curry favor with Lady Rosemon."
"f8627b56","Since then, the rest of us have had so little to eat,
it's just awful..."
"f76279e3","Defecting to the Meaty Troops would be bad for Lady Rosemon,
but...at this rate, we'll starve to death!"
"f6627870","Someone's gotta teach Vegiemon a lesson and take back those
fields! Please, you've gotta do it!"
"5628fed","Oh... I see... Urgh, my poor stomach..."
"8432c841","Take back the Palace of Thorns' fields from Vegiemon!
Please...hurry..."
"8132c388","Ahhh... I'm so hungry..."
"670f46d4","Hooray! You showed Vegiemon who's boss! Now everyone can
eat their fill of these yummy vegetables!"
"6a0f4bad","But now we're just back in the fight with the Meaty Troops.
You know, I was thinking..."
"690f4a3a","Becoming your ally is sure to end this fight sooner, right?
That's why I'll support you from the city!"
"640f421b","Lillymon joined the city!"
"9b43c691","IT IS I, HERCULESKABUTERIMON..."
"9843c1d8","BEYOND THIS POINT IS LADY ROSEMON'S ROOM..."
"9943c34b","NONE MAY PASS!"
"9e43cb6a","AND I SHALL SOUNDLY TROUNCE YOU IF YOU ATTEMPT TO PASS!"
"9f43ccdd","You won't trounce me! Bring it!
(Let's back off...)"
"9c43c804","BE WARNED THAT I AM QUITE TENACIOUS! I SHANT BE DEFEATED!!!
NO HARM SHALL BEFALL LADY ROSEMON!!!"
"9d43c9f7","THIS IS ROSEMON'S PALACE! GO, AND NEVER RETURN!!!"
"34667852","YOU RETURNED, DESPITE MY WARNINGS! BEYOND THIS POINT IS LADY
ROSEMON'S ROOM... YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!"
"336676ff","AND I SHALL SOUNDLY TROUNCE YOU IF YOU ATTEMPT TO PASS!"
"39c1a6df","...UGH...WHAT...WHAT WAS I DOING...?"
"3ac1a8b2","I SEE. I WAS UNDER ROSEMON'S SPELL... HOW EMBARRASSING.　"
"3bc1aa25","I SUPPORT NEITHER THE MEAT NOR THE VEGGIE FACTIONS...
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY YOU END THIS CONFLICT."
"34c19f20","HerculesKabuterimon joined the city!"
"5f8ab300","IT IS I, HERCULESKABUTERIMON..."
"628ab7d9","NONE MAY PROCEED PAST THIS POINT! BEGONE WITH YOU!"
"eb1c1094","It's about time you showed up. You're that human siding with
the Meaty Troops and mucking up my plans..."
"ee1c156d","Well, too late! With the energy harvested from ShineGreymon,
the laser's ready to fire on the Ohguino Wastelands!"
"ed1c13fa","Those savage Meaty Troops and all of the Wastelands will go
up in flames! But it's no fun in firing it right away..."
"e81c0bdb","I know! I'll give you one last chance... Fight me, and try
to stop me from firing the laser cannon!"
"e71c0a68","You read my mind, Rosemon!
Just...gimme a second..."
"ea1c0f21","Ho ho ho... I'll get rid of you before I take down those
Meaty Troop fools!"
"e91c0d4e","Your fear has gotten the better of you, has it? Very well...
I can wait a little while longer!"
"2716d40f","You finally came back... If you don't hurry, I might change
my mind and fire the laser right here and now, you know?"
"2816d5e2","Now then... Fight me, and try to stop me from firing the
laser cannon!"
"806f4b42","Ugh...it can't be...! If it's come to this, I'll hypnotize
you..."
"7f6f49ef","...Gasp! It doesn't work on you!!! I see...the human, and
that partner, you're...!"
"7e6f487c","...You have triumphed, Tamer. As promised, I will...stop
the laser..."
"7d6f4689","...It's not like I hate the Meaty Troops anyway, and I could
care less about winning this war..."
"7c6f4516","Thank you for stopping me. Being queen of this castle was
fun, if only for a while."
"7b6f43a3","... ... ..."
"7a6f4230","In exchange for this castle, I fell for that guy's smooth
talk. Ahh, this defeat feels like freedom! I'm so refreshed."
"896f59ad","Next I'll try going to the city! I can't wait to see what
awaits me in that new place."
"886f583a","Oh, ""that guy""? Give my regards to Myotismon the next time
you meet, okay?"
"7b6d04cc","Rosemon joined the city!"
"358df308","You there...to which troop do you belong? ...Wait, you're...
a human...?"
"358df309","End this pointless conflict. We'll talk afterwards."
"368df4fb","You there... Please listen to my tale of woe..."
"378df66e","?"
"388df7c1","Lately, I have not been able to sleep..."
"398df9b4","I have nothing keeping me up at night...but still..."
"3a8dfb27","I cannot sleep... You are a Tamer, yes? Do you know anything
about sleep in relation to Digimon?"
"3b8dfc9a","Perhaps a tool that could help me sleep... Would you know
anything about that?"
"3c8dfe0d","Hmm...how about I look for something?
Have you tried counting sheep?"
"2d8de690","You have my thanks... I'll leave it to your judgment."
"2e8de803","Some strange device may exist within Rosemon's palace..."
"3b903b71","Sheep...? I shall not rely on superstitions..."
"7ff5d800","Have you found a tool that could help me sleep?"
"82f5dcd9","Some strange device may exist within Rosemon's palace..."
"bd72246d","You got Rosemon's favorite(?) Virtual Memory Foam Pillow!"
"54d19d52","You found a useful sleeping aide, have you?"
"53d19bff","You handed over the Virtual Memory Foam Pillow!"
"52d19a0c","A pillow...an object humans use when they sleep, huh?"
"51d19899","Hmm, I lay it under my head...like this...? To think some
people sleep like thi--"
"50d19726","Oh...this fragrance! This is Rosemon's reputed hypnotic
scent!"
"4fd195b3","Yes, this will certainly help me slumber. You have sound
judgment, human!"
"4ed193c0","Human wisdom...what an unfathomable thing... Hmm, it seems
I must continue to associate with all of you."
"5cd1a9ca","Antylamon joined the city!"
"74de593e","Ohhh... Hey, did you...did you save me?"
"73de574b","I don't know who you are, but I'm so grateful... Still, why
did you come to save me in the first place?"
"72de55d8","({0} explained the situation.)"
"79de60dd","I see... While I've been captured, such a fate has befallen
these Ohguino Wastelands..."
"78de5f6a","*huff huff* My body...something's wrong...
Am I...out of energy?!"
"77de5df7","?!"
"76de5c04","It seems that the solar energy in my body was drained by
this device during my imprisonment..."
"6dde4e39","Now I get it... Those Veggie Troop fools mean to use the
stolen energy to fire a laser..."
"6cde4c46","There's not a lot of time before the cannon fires... Sorry
to ask, but please return to Leomon and ask for his advice."
"efdb4928","My beloved Ohguino Wastelands are in danger. I wish I could
fight with you, but this body would only get in your way..."
"f0db4a9b","Sorry to ask right after you rescued me...but for the sake
of restoring peace to this land, lend us your strength!"
"f1db4c0e","I see, you stopped them from firing the laser! Please, go
tell Leomon at once!"
"f930461d","...Oh, it's you! Thanks for all your help in that battle
against the Veggie Troops."
"f6304144","See, the thing is...my body took a lot of damage from having
all that solar energy drained out of it by that device..."
"f7304337","But thanks to all your hard work, peace has returned to
these Ohguino Wastelands..."
"f4303e7e","That is why I can end my watch over the Wastelands without
worry, and heal myself with this warm light shining down..."
"f5303fd1","Oh yes... I haven't thanked your properly yet...okay, I'll
make you a promise here and now!"
"f2303b18","Just wait a little longer... Once this body of mine is back
in good health, I'll join the city and lend you my support!"
"dbc25670","You remember the promise I made to you, right?"
"dec25ac9","Just wait a little longer... Once this broken body is back
to normal, I'll join the city and lend you my support!"
"b5f949cf","...Oh, it's you! Thanks for all your help in that battle
against the Veggie Troops."
"b6f94ba2","See, the thing is...my body took a lot of damage from having
all that solar energy drained out of it by that device..."
"b7f94d15","But thanks to all your hard work, peace has returned to
these Ohguino Wastelands..."
"b0f94210","That is why I could end my watch over these wastelands
without worry, and heal myself in this warm sunlight..."
"b1f94383","Please allow me to thank you again!"
"b2f94576","And now I go to the city, to lend you my strength!"
"b3f946e9","ShineGreymon joined the city!"
"5d5274da","Dee hee?! Who the heck're you?!"
"5d5274db","Hmm...naw man, this won't work! I can't leave this to a
scrawny punk like you!"
"5e52764d","Dee hee! Say, man, you like treasure? I bet you do!"
"5b5271f4","?"
"5c527367","The truth is, a great pirate of the Digi-seas finally wound up
here after his last voyage!"
"59526eae","According to legend, the captain retired from the seas, and
lives here to this day..."
"5a527001","There's a super-valuable Holy Chalice hidden somewhere
around here! That's where you come in, buddy..."
"57526b48","Would you look for the Holy Chalice? We can sell it and
split the profits 50/50!"
"58526d3b","Sure!
I have to keep going..."
"55526862","Dee hee hee! Sounds like you get the picture. So get this,
I heard that the Holy Chalice was actually hidden..."
"565269d5","...stashed away by this crazy-strong Digimon pirate captain
by the name of Vikemon..."
"43548aa3","Aw c'mon, you can't pass up a story like this, can ya?!"
"66a6e3ee","The former pirate captain Vikemon is somewhere here in
MOD Cape."
"65a6e27b","I want to lay my peepers on that treasure, the Holy Chalice!"
"906ff65b","Dee hee hee! Did ya find the Holy Chalice?"
"916ff7ce","You handed over the Holey Chalice!"
"926ff9a1","Huh? What's this worn-out thing? ...Don't tell me this is
the Holy Chalice?"
"936ffb14","(You related Vikemon's trip down memory lane.)"
"946ffc87","Aww maaaan, the great pirate Vikemon, of all people, thinks
of memories as treasures?!"
"956ffe7a","What a crazy romantic! But I guess that's pirates for you...
completely out of touch with reality."
"966fffed","*sigh* There go my dreams of living on easy street...
Ah well, I'll see what moolah I can scrounge up in the city."
"876fe870","DemiDevimon joined the city!"
"a6c92224","Hey you...huh? Oh wait, never mind..."
"a6c92225","Come back once the city's gotten bigger. I won't ask
anything of you until then."
"a7c92397","Hey! Hey, you! You look like a pretty good fisherman!"
"a8c9250a","?"
"a9c926fd","I'm Seadramon! I want to open a fishing hole in the city,
but..."
"a2c91bf8","The fish I'm raising to start with aren't nearly enough..."
"a3c91d6b","That's where an awesome fisherman like you comes in...
I want you to catch me a bunch of fish!"
"a4c91ede","I'll need some Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi! What do you
say, will you help me?"
"a5c920b1","A bunch of fish, coming up!
I'm not that good at fishing..."
"9ec9154c","You'll angle them for me?! Alright, let me tell you those
fish I need again, just in case!"
"9fc9173f","A Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi! One of each will do.
Thanks in advance!"
"accb6a2d","Oh yeah? Well come on back if you get better at fishing!"
"e4e40e7c","I need you to catch three kinds of fish for my fishing hole!"
"e7e41335","A Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi! One of each will do.
Thanks in advance!"
"64922749","Oh hey! You caught some Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi
for me?!"
"619222f0","Here's the Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi!
Now's not a good time..."
"62922463","You handed over the Digifry, Digicrucian and Digikoi!"
"67922c02","Great! These plucky little dudes are of good stock. Now I
can open up the fishing hole I've always wanted!"
"68922df5","Oh, right! I have to thank you for catching all those fish
for me. Take this!"
"6592293c","You got a Feather Lure!"
"66922aaf","A fisherman like you can make good use of this baby!"
"6b92324e","Come hang out once I've opened my fishing hole in the city!
I'll have all kinds of specimens waiting for you!"
"6c923421","Seadramon joined the city!"
"e995375f","That's too bad... Well, come on back whenever you want!"
"42e9d6cd","I'm ExVeemon...are you a...human?"
"42e9d6cc","Ah, sorry, I can't really help you with anything right now.
Wish I could be of more help!"
"41e9d55a","Oh, you're the...human people talk about, right? For some
reason, you take on requests from us Digimon."
"40e9d3e7","Leave it to me!
Little busy right now..."
"3fe9d274","Oh hey, awesome. I'm ExVeemon! I've been looking for a
certain Digimon for a while now."
"3ee9d081","Have you ever heard of Magnamon?"
"3de9cf2e","He's a Royal Knight clad in brilliant golden armor! He
should have finally appeared somewhere in this world."
"3ce9cdbb","He is a legendary being without parallel. I've looked all
over, but haven't been able to find him."
"3be9cbc8","If I ever met him, I'd want his autograph! That's why if YOU
get a chance to meet him, please get one for me!"
"3ae9ca55","As for where he could be, well...I've looked everywhere, and
just about given up."
"39e9c8e2","First I'd recommend going to Veedramon and see what he says.
He's been looking for Magnamon, too."
"3ce78ec4","Veedramon should be in Absolute Zero. Go find him!"
"3de790b7","I see. Well, if you ever have some free time, come on back!"
"888a9d39","Ask Veedramon in Absolute Zero where you can find Magnamon."
"858a9860","I imagine it'll be tough, but please, you gotta do it!"
"79f4f6c","Were you able to meet with Veedramon? You can trust any info
that comes from him."
"a9f5425","...Huh? But will Magnamon give me his autograph, you ask?
Hmm...well, do something to get it, would ya?"
"b13f4d43","...Oh wow, you really did it!"
"b23f4f36","You handed over Magnamon's Autograph!"
"b33f50a9","Huh? He's got a message for me? Whoa, that's awesome!"
"b43f521c","..."
"b53f538f","Oh, I see. Just getting an autograph from my idol won't make
me strong like Magnamon... That's his advice, huh?"
"b63f5562","I understand, I was going about things the wrong way.
This experience has taught me that."
"b73f56d5","I'll go to the city, too, and work to become a Digimon
others can look up to. Please tell Veedramon and Magnamon!"
"b83f5848","ExVeemon joined the city!"
"e0823e3d","They call me Stingmon. I have nothing to say to you at the
moment."
"df823c4a","I'm Stingmon. I see you're the type that can't pass up
problems."
"de823ad7","You wouldn't just reject my request, would ya?"
"dd823964","What is it?
Laaame..."
"dc8237f1","Just as I thought. All right, listen up."
"db82361e","I want you to deliver my letter to a certain Digimon.
Now hold on, I know what you want to say."
"da8234ab","Normally you can just get by with a DigiMail, right?"
"d9823338","See, I want to contact MegaKabuterimon, but no matter how
many DigiMails I send, I never get a reply."
"d8823145","This started one day without warning...plus he's always
traveling, so he never settles on one place..."
"d7822fd2","Well, that's the deal. That's why I have to ask a
trustworthy globe-trotter like you."
"da7ff634","You got Stingmon's Letter!"
"db7ff7a7","There's no rush, but if you run into MegaKabuterimon, please
hand over that letter."
"dc7ff91a","Please don't open it, though. It's a letter, not a telegram,
all right?"
"dd7ffa8d","Sorry, I know you wouldn't do something like that..."
"d67fef88","All right, with this all of my regrets are gone. Guess I'll
head back to Floatia..."
"d77ff17b","What, you're calling all us Digimon back to Floatia?!
Perfect, I'll head right on over."
"d87ff2ee","Stingmon joined the city!"
"d97ff441","Oh. I guess like I misread you. Don't worry about it."
"99b8fde9","I'm Stingmon. I see you're the type that can't pass up
problems."
"96b8f910","You wouldn't just reject my request, would ya?"
"97b8fa83","What is it?
Laaame..."
"9cb902a2","Just as I thought. Well then, I'll get right on it..."
"9db90415","...Oh wait, you can't right now. Sorry, but can you make
some room in your inventory?"
"9ab8ff5c","Please come back when you do, if you could."
"9bb900cf","Oh. I guess like I misread you. Don't worry about it."
"39a523d4","...Gotta remodel the wing...utilize the horns as
stabilizers..."
"39a523d5","...Huh? Who're you? No matter, I doubt you could understand
my research..."
"3aa52547","...Hey you, can you show me your partner Digimon for a sec?"
"3ba5273a","Hmm hmm hmm...this aerodynamic form reduces drag, and
increases attack speed, huh..."
"3ca528ad","Oh, how rude of me...I am AeroVeedramon. I'm researching
Digimon forms and functions!"
"35a51da8","I have a favor to ask about that. In order to gather some
research data, could I battle your partner Digimon?"
"36a51f1b","If it helps with your research!
Sorry, can't right now..."
"37a5208e","Oh! You'll accept my request! I want some extremely accurate
data! Come at me at full power!"
"38a52261","That is unfortunate... Well then, I'll try asking at the
next opportunity..."
"d6918cec","You've come back!"
"d99191a5","Would you allow me to battle your Digimon today, to get data
for my research...?"
"577cdab9","Okay, okay! That's enough! Thanks to you, I have acquired
more than enough data!"
"547cd5e0","Still...the movements of your Digimon cannot be explained by
my hypothesis..."
"557cd753","Perhaps...I have stumbled upon some new research data! Oh,
and I heard there's a research lab in the city, yes?"
"5a7cdf72","Okay, I'll go get a detailed analysis of this precious data!
You have my heartfelt thanks for helping me acquire it!"
"5b7ce0e5","AeroVeedramon joined the city!"
"d5c34c4f","That guy still ain't back? Tch, what a stubborn guy... How
about showing your face around here for a..."
"d5c34c4e","What the--who the heck're you?! I wasn't saying anything,
so get on out of here!"
"d4c34adc","...Say, you there! Wouldja listen to my story for a minute?"
"d7c34f95","I'm all ears!
Sorry, now's not a good time..."
"d6c34e22","I appreciate it, pal! The thing is, I've been thinking about
heading to Floatia sometime soon..."
"d1c34603","But before I do, something's been nagging at me...
It's about my apprentice, Gumdramon..."
"d0c34490","A real conceited brat, that Digimon! He never listens, so I
went and popped him one!"
"d3c34969","He called me an idiot and ran off...haven't seen him since.
I've got a short fuse, too, so...my hand moved on its own..."
"d2c347f6","So do me a favor, would you go apologize to him for me?
He should be at Logic Volcano..."
"ddc35927","Hmph... Yer made of ice, ya know that?!"
"966b2bf7","Go apologize to my apprentice Gumdramon for me!"
"976b2d6a","He should be at Logic Volcano... Thanks for going out of
your way for me like this!"
"7a84de8a","Oh-hoh! You told Gumdramon I was sorry?! ...Huh, so that
punk felt bad about the whole thing too, did he?"
"7984dd17","...What? He said he's gonna go wait for me in the city?!
Lookit this guy, going the extra mile!"
"7884dba4","I made you worry too, didn't I, buddy? ...my bad. Master and
apprentice will be back together in no time! Peace out!"
"7784da31","Zudomon joined the city!"
"96fb8526","Ho ho ho..."
"96fb8527","Who, me? I'm just chilling here, pay me no mind."
"97fb8699","Well now, we've got ourselves a human here! What're you
doing around these parts?"
"94fb81c0","The name's Vikemon... I used to go around causing trouble,
but these days I'm out of the game..."
"95fb83b3","You were a great pirate captain, right?
If this story's gonna take a while I'll come back later..."
"9afb8b52","Ah HA, I get it. You came to ask about the pirate treasure,
am I right?"
"9bfb8cc5","Sorry to disappoint, but I split all my treasure among my
crew when we disbanded. There's not a Digi-doubloon left."
"98fb880c","Now I enjoy a life of catching fish and living off the sea.
There's nothing left... Well, that is..."
"99fb89ff","Ha ha ha! Yes, there's that... If you beat me, I'll tell you
what I mean!"
"9efb919e","Sure, go home if you're done here. There's nothing for you
here, y'see."
"5c2e2f3a","Argh, avast, avast! I give, playtime's over."
"5b2e2d47","I'm a 'mon of my word! I'll tell you about the treasure."
"5a2e2bd4","This chalice here...it's probably the source of the rumor
about some ""Holy Chalice."""
"592e2a61","?"
"582e288e","During my pirate days, I'd hold feasts every night with the
other sailors, drink my fill from this chalice, and go nuts!"
"572e271b","That's why this here chalice, filled to the brim with such
fond memories, is my treasure...my ""holy chalice""..."
"562e25a8","Heh heh, you must think that's pretty silly. Here, take this
as a symbol of your victory over me."
"552e2435","You got a Holey Chalice!"
"542e2242","No point in indulging in those memories anymore... I'll take
this opportunity to turn over a new leaf!"
"572be8a4","I still have plenty to teach those young'uns out there.
Ha ha ha, what 'til they get a load o' me!"
"582bea17","Vikemon joined the city!"
"5f80b27","Well now, we've got ourselves a human here! What're you
doing around these parts?"
"6f80c9a","The name's Vikemon... I used to go around causing trouble,
but these days I'm out of the game..."
"7f80e0d","You were a great pirate captain, right?
If this story's gonna take a while I'll come back later..."
"f80308","Ah HA, I get it. You came to ask about the pirate treasure,
am I right?"
"1f804fb","Hey, first let me teach you something good."
"2f8066e","If you're gonna hunt for buried treasure, better have a
place to put it first. That's one of the basics, kid! Ha ha!"
"3f807c1","Sure, go home if you're done here. There's nothing for you
here, y'see."
"8a5205a6","Who're you? You look greedy..."
"89520433","You got something to say to MegaSeadramon?"
"88520240","I want your Fishy Picture...
Who, me? Nope..."
"8f520d45","What?! You want my Fishy Picture?! Are you funnin' me, son?!"
"8e520bd2","A Fishy Picture's something you get from fish, right?
I ain't a fish, I'm a Digimon!"
"8d520a7f","And not any old Digimon, either. Among sea dragon types, I'm
an elite Perfect Digimon!"
"8c52088c","You'd do best to remember..."
"935213f1","(You talked about Gomamon.)"
"9252121e","Gomamon! Huh... I got no idea what that squirt is
thinking..."
"854fbf10","Still, it's not like I can ignore the kid. And besides,
you went and made a promise to him."
"864fc083","Let's see, what to do... Hm, I've got just the ticket."
"874fc276","This ancient illustration has been handed down in my clan
for generations. My ancestor drew it millennia ago."
"884fc3e9","Looks pretty awful, doesn't it? To be honest, I really don't
see the value in it. Here, it's all yours."
"894fc55c","You got the MegaSea Fishy Picture!"
"8a4fc6cf","It may seem like I'm tricking the kid, but don't worry.
I'll explain the truth next time I meet Gomamon."
"8b4fc8a2","I'll be waiting in the city. You should invite Gomamon, too.
That'd be good for you, wouldn't it?"
"8c4fca15","I'm pretty knowledgeable when it comes to fish, heh heh.
I'm sure it'll help you out!"
"8d4fcb88","MegaSeadramon joined the city!"
"8e4fcd7b","What the heck... If you ain't got no business with me, then
shove off!"
"a9069745","Who're you? You look greedy..."
"a606928c","You got something to say to MegaSeadramon?"
"a706947f","I want your Fishy Picture...
Who, me? Nope..."
"a4068fa6","What?! You want my Fishy Picture?! Are you funnin' me, son?!"
"a5069119","You can't hold any more items and you want my Fishy Picture?"
"a2068c40","I don't got nothing to say to you. Shove off! Next time,
save a little space in your inventory."
"a3068e33","What the heck... If you ain't got no business with me, then
shove off!"
"f6a228a3","Hey! That Digisalmon... did you get it in the waters around
here? Digisalmon have been hard to find in this sea lately."
"f7a22a16","You fish quite a bit, don't ya?! MetalSeadramon don't play
nice with people who mess up the ocean!"
"f8a22b89","You've got the wrong guy!
Sorry, sorry!"
"f9a22d7c","What? You're feigning ignorance?!"
"faa22eef","Then what're you holding on to that Digisalmon for?! You're
gonna eat it, aren't you?!"
"fba23042","No more excuses, I've got all the proof I need."
"fca23235","Let's put it to the test! If you don't come around here,
the Digisalmon population should return to normal!"
"fda233a8","...I won't let you do any more fishing! All right, now get
outta here!"
"e691d48","Urrgh, what'd you say?! But if it's not you, then who..."
"11692201","...?"
"106920ae","Ha ha ha! I see, it was my mistake!"
"13692567","...!"
"126923f4","Digisalmon have a complicated ecology. Every few years they
migrate around oceans on a massive scale."
"1569284d","That must be what's happening now. Sorry, I've been asleep
for a while, so I'm a bit out of it."
"146926da","I'm sorry. It's hardly compensation, but take this thing I
found on the sea floor."
"7691243","You got a Platinum Poop Medal!"
"66910d0","Hmm, but y'know, there's a reason I'm out of it. Ever seen I
woke up I've been gathering bits and pieces of info."
"966d732","It sounds like all sorts of things are in motion around the
world now. Maybe I should head to Floatia myself."
"a66d8a5","MetalSeadramon joined the city!"
"ab8bd5b5","Hey! That Digisalmon... did you get it in the waters around
here? Digisalmon have been hard to find in this sea lately."
"a88bd0fc","You fish quite a bit, don't ya?! MetalSeadramon don't play
nice with people who mess up the ocean!"
"a98bd26f","You've got the wrong guy!
Sorry, sorry!"
"a68bcd96","All those fish filling up your inventory... It'd be a joke
to make excuses in a condition like this, you know?"
"a78bcf09","Get out of here, or I can't be held responsible for what
happens next!"
"a48bcab0","If you want to make excuses, at least get rid of some items
first. Don't underestimate me, human."
"a58bcc23","...I won't let you do any more fishing! All right, now get
outta here!"
"e1cfe515","A Tamer accompanied by two Digimon that saved this
world... You must be {0}."

but...I hate being in groups."
"dfcfe1cf","Doing what I want on my own like this suits me just fine...
Heh, sorry... Just running my mouth here..."
"dccfdd76","Now, what I want is a bout with a warrior such as yourself.
What do you say...? Feel like a fight with me?"
"ddcfdee9","You got it! Let's rumble!
I can't fight right now!"
"dacfda10","You'll fight without even asking my reason. I like that
spirit! Okay, let's have some fun!"
"dbcfdb83","There is certainly a fated time for battle... Very well.
I'll wait here until that time..."
"2091c4b6","{0}... I was growing impatient..."
"1f91c2c3","Are you in the mood to fight this time...?"
"2e236c83","Heh heh... You're just as interesting as I'd imagined!"
"2f236e76","I, who fight alone, and you, who fight with two Digimon...
We do things differently, yet we seek the same strength."

something you're worthy of doing!"
"936a9152","...What's that? You makin' fun of my boots? Don't you know
sick kicks when ya see 'em?!"
"8e6a89b3","Awww I can't take it anymore, all these negative vibes
you're putting out are driving me nuts!"
"8d6a87c0","This is a pretty nasty accusation...
(This seems like it'd be annoying, let's get out of here...)"
"906a8c99","Oh ho! You're sounding just as cheeky as ever! I'll send
you packing!"
"8f6a8b26","You gonna run? C'mon, say something, punk!"

what's going on here?!"
"5ef1a5a1","Ugh, I don't get it! At times like this...best to make a
break for it!"
"5df1a3ce","Nanimon joined the city!"
"77dc1537","Ugh, it stinks! Like, really, really stinks! What is that
nauseating stench?"
"78dc16aa","...Ugh, it's you! You're the one giving off that awful
smell! Even a sewer wouldn't reek so badly..."
"79dc181d","It's enough to make one's nose go crooked! Not that I have a
nose, but still..."
"72dc0d18","...Anyway! Get out of here, and quick! Or maybe you wanna
whiff of my special fragrance here?!"
"73dc0e8b","I don't smell anything...
(I don't want that ""special fragrance"" on me... Let's jet!)"
"74dc107e","Wha'? You can't discern my delectable aroma?! That's it,
I've had it! I'll chase you out myself!"
"75dc11d1","Hoh boy... I can't stand people with no sense of smell.
Seriously, what's wrong with you?!"
"b634341c","...Ugh, it stinks! Not you again!"
"b93438d5","Get out of here, and quick! If not, how about I give you a
whiff of my special fragrance here?!"
"162c8969","*cough* You're a real piece of work! Wait...are you a human?"
"132c8490","Could it be that humans can't perceive smells?!"
"142c8603","I see, that's why you don't know you smell like a sewer...
Poor thing..."

one to leave. Farewell!"

gonna get hurt."

been standing there?"
"a6c82507","What's wrong?
(Just pretend like you didn't see anything...)"
"a5c82394","I might just be lucky, you know? Help me out here."
"a4c82221","Lately two ferocious Digimon have been fighting here in
Faulty Ex Machina...rampaging anytime and any place."

actually gotten serious..."
"a1c81d68","I've stopped them time and time again, but I had to give up
to save myself. Still, maybe you can do something to help?"

MetalGreymon and MetalTyrannomon."

something!"

They...didn't realize I was there...?!"

getting's good... Thanks for your help!"

"4527c6cc","Fine. As long as there's no surprise attacks that's fine by
me! I'll turn you into scrap fair and square!"
"4627c8bf","What?! You're the one that loves surprise attacks, you jerk!
You gonna act like this wound on my heel ain't your fault?"
"4327c3e6","That's fresh, coming from you! Lookit this wound on my shin
and tell me your electronic brain ain't on the fritz!"
"4427c559","Wait! I was asked to mediate this fight!
(Maybe I shouldn't get involved...)"
"4127c080","Who the heck're you?! Outsiders should back off! If you plan
on getting in the way, I'll start by filling you with holes!"
"4227c273","Hey, you there! This ain't a spectator sport! Clear off if
you don't wanna get hurt!"
"fd3428e6","Not you again?! I told you this ain't a show! Don't get in
our way!"
"fc342773","If you don't want to get caught up in this fight, I suggest
you get lost! You won't make it out unscathed!"
"7ce24233","Ugh. Fine, fine, we'll call a truce! You say someone asked
you to step in?"
"7de243a6","Hmm, MetalMamemon, you say?! Jeez, why didn't he just come
himself?"
"7ee24519","Hmm... Hold on a sec...the height of this heel wound! And
now that I think about it, your shin wound..."
"7fe2468c","Could it be this wasn't a surprise attack from you, but an
injury I got when MetalMamemon tried to stop us?!"
"80e2487f","Yeah, he's so small we must not have noticed him! Sorry,
we'll head to the city after talking to him!"
"81e249d2","MetalGreymon and MetalTyrannomon joined the city!"

"ec7b7086","?"
"ed7b7279","Hey, you know cell phones, right? Humans can't send
transmissions without a cell phone?"
"ee7b73ec","I tried making one of those cell phone things myself.
They're pretty rare around these parts, y'see."
"ef7b755f","I wanted to show it off to my friends, but...before I knew
it, I'd lost it..."
"f07b7732","All right, I'll go look for it.
Sorry, can't right now."
"f17b78a5","For real?! Oh, but there's just one problem..."
"f27b7a18","The bridge connecting Pathfork Island to Boulder Island has
been down recently, so we can't go over there..."
"f37b7b8b","Pressing the switch in the Control Room should lower the
bridge..."
"f07db5a9","I don't know the details...so can I also ask you to lower
the bridge to Boulder Island?"
"ef7db436","I'll do something in return to thank you for your help!
Sorry for the hassle!"
"ee7db243","Oh?! I see. Hmm, that sucks..."
"17ca8cf8","Go find the cell phone I dropped on Boulder Island!"
"1aca91b1","First, drop the bridge to Boulder Island... The switch must
be in the Control Room."
"c19468e5","The bridge between Pathfork Island and Boulder Island has
been lowered!"
"fd80392a","Did you find the cell phone I dropped on Boulder Island?"
"fc8037b7","It looks like you lowered the bridge to Boulder Island.
Please look a bit more!"
"7aed2d17","You picked up Rapidmon's Cell Phone(?)!"
"b80817fc","Oh, you found my cell phone on Boulder Island?!"
"bb081cb5","You handed over Rapidmon's Cell Phone!"

"b5081323","Huh? It's not right?"
"b40811b0","A...flip...phone...? That sounds...complicated. Ah, well..."

about cell phones next time!"

at mach speed! So we gonna do this or what?!"
"6487847f","...Wah ha ha!!! Couldn't keep up with my speed, could ya?"
"658785d2","You're still hesitating! That's what's stopping you from
going at full speed!"
"66878745","If you get it, loser, then scram! I'll take any rematch
requests at mach speed!"
"5df53ba0","So fast!!! Did all my moves look like slow motion to you?"

I'll join you guys!"

What do they call this area?"

Bony Resort
Phony Resort"
"7e5014c3","You are correct! That was just a warm-up, the rest won't
be so easy!"

"84501e55","Sorry, but that's game over! You can try again anytime,
so come on back!"
"2057c2dc","Moving on to Question #2!
How many horns do Lopmon and Terriermon have altogether?"

Five horns
Nine horns"
"2257c622","Correct again! Lookit the brainiac over here! Terriermon's
single horn plus Lopmon's three horns add up to four!"
"1d57be03","BZZZT!!! Soooo wrong!"
"1c57bc90","That's all she wrote, buddy. But come back and try again!"
"d3ca50f3","All right, time for your final question!"
"d4ca5266","Aw man, I'm getting butterflies in my stomach!"
"d5ca53d9","Okay, here we go... Question #3!
Which one isn't brown: Terriermon, or Lopmon?!"
"d6ca554c","Terriermon
Lopmon"
"d7ca573f","Correctamundo!!! That's right, the one that isn't brown is
me, Terriermon!"
"d8ca5892","BZZZT!! Too bad, so sad! And you were so close to beating

Anything is okay, really."

the city!"

city! Byeee-byeee!"

you'll listen to my request."
"a1d355d1","I'm all ears!
Sorry, now's not a good time..."
"a0d3547e","I thought you'd say that!"
"a3d35937","I used to live in the city, you know. But some things
happened, so I set out on a magical quest."
"a2d35744","Now I'm about ready to head back, though. It's crazy out
here!"
"a5d35c1d","The thing is, I want you to tell Garurumon to head back to
the city, too."
"a4d35aaa","We have a certain contract, the two of us, but for some
reason I can't contact him. Would you relay the message?"
"97d34613","That's a shame... Sorry to hold you up. Still, if you change
your mind, please come talk to me!"
"4fbd8733","Garurumon should be in the Ohguino Wastelands."
"50bd88a6","If you spot him, tell him to come back to the city for me,
okay?"
"d00f6de6","Oh, looks like you spoke to Garurumon! Wonder why I haven't
heard from him...?"
"cf0f6c73","No matter. Time to head back to the old city, I suppose...
That Taomon's back too, isn't he?"
"ce0f6a80","His Taoist arts and my sorcery, I wonder which one is more
useful? I'll let you decide, heh heh."
"d50f7585","Wizardmon joined the city!"
"9246ede2","..."

it'll be awake anytime soon..."
"9346ef55","..."
"9046ea9c","...What're you doing in a place like this?
(...Just leave it be.)"
"9146ec0f","You found me!"
"8e46e7b6","I was playing hide-and-go-seek, see.
Well, ya got me!"
"8f46e929","It wouldn't end until you found me! Jeez, human games are
pretty weaksauce..."
"8c46e450","That's why I wanna play a new game! I'll go look for one in
the city!"
"8d46e5c3","Mamemon joined the city!"

"9b46fbcd","... (:_;)"
"108a0059","Who're you? Hmph... Haven't seen you around before."
"108a0058","I imagine it's hard for you to understand my ideal. There's
no worth in committing you to memory."
"f89fee6","Oh... It's you, is it? The human helping develop the city..."
"e89fd73","?"
"d89fb80","My name is Myotismon..."
"148a0685","I conduct all sorts of business with the goal of developing
each area, including the Bony Resort here..."
"138a0512","Yes... All sorts...hee hee! I thought I'd like to have a
pow-wow with you, just once."
"128a03bf","Everything you're doing is turning Floatia into a
fascinating place. I might even invest a bit myself."
"118a01cc","Anyway...business is business! Would you fulfil my request
as a condition of our deal?"
"188a0d31","Sure, I'm all ears!
Let me think about it..."
"178a0b5e","Right answer! Okay, I'll get to the point. There's but one
thing I desire..."
"a87b850","And that is my treasured parasol... My stolen Myobrella...
Please get it back!"
"b87b9c3","It's my favorite, you see... Without it, I just can't go out
during the day at my leisure."
"c87bbb6","The thief Turuiemon is at Logic Volcano... There's no time
to lose! Recover my Myobrella at once!"
"d87bd29","Yes, of course... There is a time and a place for business.
Do as you wish."
"5a7da185","Turuiemon, the one who stole my precious Myobrella, is at
Logic Volcano..."
"577d9ccc","Hurry up and retrieve my Myobrella at once!"
"de4de218","Ho ho ho... I see you retrieved my Myobrella from that jerk
Turuiemon!"
"e14de6d1","You handed over the Myobrella!"
"e04de57e","Yes, this is the one... Such elegance... Such craftsmanship.
Exquisite!"
"e34dea37","You've done well for me, human. True to my word, I shall
invest in your endeavors."
"e24de844","...Hmm? No need, you say? Well then, that's not very good
business, now is it?"
"e54ded1d","Well now let's see, you're gathering Digimon in Floatia, are
you not?"
"e44debaa","My presence in the city would be worth more to you than a
simple investment. Ho ho, perhaps business isn't your forte."
"d74dd713","The truth is, my original goal was to buy up works of art."
"d64dd5a0","This might be the right time to fulfill that dream. Time to
get started on my business! I'll cover the costs, of course."
"5a4ad3f5","Myotismon joined the city!"
"7bda21e3","Wow! Hey, yo! You lookin' REAL fly!"
"7cda2356","?"
"7dda24c9","Those items ya got... Ohhh I get it, you're that human!"
"7eda26bc","Ah, me? WereGarurumon's the name! Me, I like my items a
little flashy."
"7fda282f","I say items, but it's more like fashion, dig? Say, you know
what a SkullGrey Ring is?"
"80da2982","It's this must-have item SkullGreymon has, man! I just gotta
get my hands on it."
"81da2b75","I'll go ask for it!
What do I care about fashion?"
"82da2ce8","Duuuude, thank you thank you THANK you! You feel me, you
really feel me!"
"83da2e5b","SkullGreymon is in the Bony Resort. Try to haggle when you
find him, a'ight?!"

You can do it, buddy!"
"5d02dff5","Wha'--HOW!!! You got a SkullGrey Ring?!"
"5a02db3c","You handed over the SkullGrey Ring!"
"5b02dcaf","AHH-WOO-WOO-WOOOOO! You're amazing, kid! Check it
out, this engraving right here is just DOPE, ain't it?!"
"5802d7d6","S got a real, y'know, skull-y grey-y feel to it, yeah?
It's perfect, just perfect..."
"5902d949","Whoops, my bad, dawg. Lookit me, yappin' away like a lil'
pup. I just gotta thank you, man!"
"5602d4f0","You and I, we know what's up when it comes to items, you
feel me? How 'bout we put this good taste to use in a shop?"
"5702d663","All right all right all right, let's do it! I'm gonna break
new ground in Floatia, just you wait!"
"6402eafa","WereGarurumon joined the city!"
"44d28077","..."
"44d28076","I'm meditating right now... Please come back later..."
"43d27e84","Oh...a human? You must've come from that ""city"" thing."
"46d2835d","My appearance doesn't upset you? How unexpected. Well, what
can I do for you?"
"45d281ea","Please give me a SkullGrey Ring!
Not a single thing!"
"40d279cb","A SkullGrey Ring? I guess I do have one of those..."
"3fd27858","I'm afraid I can't just give it away for free, though.
Of course, I'm not talking about money."
"42d27d11","Not a lot of people come up and talk to me, looking like I
do. I'm so bored!"
"41d27bbe","I want to do something to get the old motor running. That
work for you?"
"3cd2739f","Oh, okay... I don't understand you humans..."
"8c72d37f","Oof, I surrender! Okay, here's one ring. What do you plan
to do with this, exactly?"
"8d72d4d2","(You talked about WereGarurumon.)"
"8e72d645","Oh, WereGarurumon said that, did he? I would've been more
than happy to hand it over if he'd come himself."
"8772cb40","?!"
"8872cd33","I'm pretty particular myself when it comes to items. Who
wouldn't be happy to meet someone so like-minded?"
"8972cea6","Most folks run the other way when they see me, so I spent a
bunch of time doing arts and crafts by myself."
"8a72d019","I was getting pretty lonely here, to be honest... If someone
out there can understand me, I'll move on."
"9372de64","You got a SkullGrey Ring!"
"9472dfd7","Invite WereGarurumon along, too. Okay, I suppose I'll head
towards the city."
"917519f5","I'm a bit worried about whether I'll frighten people there,
but I'm sure it'll all work out!"
"90751802","SkullGreymon joined the city!"
"72190cf2","Oh...a human? You must've come from that ""city"" thing."
"71190b1f","My appearance doesn't upset you? How unexpected. Well, what
can I do for you?"
"701909ac","Please give me a SkullGrey Ring!
Not a single thing!"
"6f190839","A SkullGrey Ring? I guess I do have one of those..."
"6e190646","But, um...where exactly would you plan on putting it?"
"6d1904d3","To think you'd come here asking for an item with a full
inventory... You humans sure are a funny bunch."
"6c190360","Oh, okay... I don't understand you humans..."
"e26adbc1","Oh hey, you there! Come chat a bit, I gotta talk to ya!"
"df6ad708","?"

Resort!"

"e56ae09a","But wouldn't ya know it, about thirty minutes into
rehearsal, tragedy struck poor ol' me!"
"e66ae20d","The battery! On my mic! It just plumb ran out! Out of the
blue, just...BZZT, and it's dead!"
"e36addb4","That's why I need ya to bring me a spare battery! This
beautiful voice just can't reach the fans without that mic!"
"e46adf27","That's just awful! You can count on me.
You're pretty loud as-is, do you really need a mic?"
"d96acdf6","Oh? You'll help me?! What a good little human you are!
I wasn't wrong when I picked ya out of the crowd!"
"da6acf69","This mic takes a Digi-Battery, ya dig? If you look around a
Power Plant you should be able to find one! Thanks, baby!"

"eb5dc99e","Hey! Hey! You there! Could ya look for a Platinum Poop Medal
for me?"
"ea5dc82b","?"
"e95dc6b8","I've got more money than I know what to do with, and my
hobbies are just as gorgeous! And by that, I mean..."
"f05dd1bd","...objects made of platinum! Thanks to the power of money,
I've gathered many such objects..."
"ef5dcfca","But I lost my most precious item! Of course, I'm talking
about the one-of-kind Platinum Poop Medal!"
"ee5dce57","Without this, my platinum collection is incomplete! That's
why I want you to look for the Platinum Poop Medal!"
"ed5dcce4","Sure!
I have to keep going..."
"e45dbe99","Great! So you'll take my request! Still, I wonder where my
Platinum Poop Medal went to..."
"e35dbd26","I don't remember at all... I know it's an odd request, but
please find it!"

"9c401c29","You handed over the Platinum Poop Medal!"
"9b401ab6","You've done so much to bring it back to me...I swear I won't
lose it this time!"
"9e401f0f","*gulp!* ...I won't lose it if I eat it, that's for sure!
What a great idea. Uh...hold on..."
"9d401d9c","I'm getting some crazy déjà vu here... OHHHHHHH!!
So THAT'S what happened! I swallowed the medal last time..."
"a0402255","...and flushed it down the toilet the next time I went!"
"9f4020e2","...Jeez, I'm so sorry... This is all my fault... As a way of
apologizing...Ill go to the city..."
"a24025bb","PlatinumNumemon joined the city!"

...you know, money?"
"1da20ce1","If you submit an offering, something good will surely...
happen to you..."
"1aa20828","I'm happy to give!
Smells fishy to me..."
"1ba2099b","You have our gratitude... Now then, how much... shall you

something good to happen."

"9abde3bb","You donated 5,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"9bbde52e","5,000 <icon>BIT</icon>...for us?"
"9cbde681","A slightly more...potent...feeling...will make it easier for

I will be waiting!"
"5622e624","You donated 10,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"

king, I was cursed in exchange for sealing the demon king."
"5222dff8","...?"
"5522e4b1","My soul was...bound to this church of bone, forced to
collect donations..."
"5422e2de","It seems the hidden code to free me was a human like you
donating such a large sum to me."
"4f22db3f","As thanks for saving me, I'll return the favor! I'll go to
help out in the city."
"4e22d94c","Huh? ""What about my 10,000 <icon>BIT</icon>, you say...?

"bf37e2f0","Mwahahaha! It's you, the happy-go-lucky human they say saved
the world..."
"c237e749","It's written all over your face. You think you're justice
personified, don'tcha? Freaking irritating, man!"
"c137e5d6","I'm Barbamon..."
"c437eaaf","And I'm Creepymon!"
"c337e93c","...I SENSE DELICIOUS ENERGY!!!"
"c637edf5","And this one is Leviamon! We're part of the Seven Deadly
Digimon... You've heard of us, haven't you?"
"c537ec02","Enough with the self-promotion already, Barbamon..."
"c837f0db","Mwahaha! What's your hurry, Creepymon?!"
"c737ef68","Listen up, human. You're the reason we came here..."
"da35ce9a","We wanna make you one of us! It's like what you've been
doing, but backwards, y'know?"
"db35d00d","We call ourselves the Seven Deadly Digimon...but we don't
even number half that! You get it, right? You give in?"
"d835cbb4","I WANNA EAT THAT ENERGY! COME ON, LEMME EAT IT!!!"
"d935cd27","The thing is, see, Leviamon here is just itching to fight
you! On the off chance you beat us, we'll give up!"
"d635c86e","Let's do it!
I can't right now!"
"d735c9c1","Huh. Was this your plan all along?! Fine with us, human,
we'll see how tough you really are!"
"d435c508","Say what? Don't tell me you're scared of us...? Fine, fine.
It's just a matter of time before you fall by our hands!"
"8d2cbc6b","Mwahahaha! You finally feel like throwing down with us,
you foolish human?!"
"8e2cbdde","...NNG...NNNNGHH...I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER!!!"
"8f2cbfb1","You said it, Leviamon... Our patience is wearing thin...
C'mon, accept our invitation this time!"

you know?!"
"5753e3cb","Haaahahahaha! I gotta say, I'm pretty satisfied! Doesn't
look like Leviamon's had his fill yet, though..."
"5653e258","...GIVE ME MORE BATTLE ENERGY! GIVE IT TO ME!!!"
"5d53ed5d","Wish I could say I was fed up with all this, but who cares?!
You joining us, us joining you, what's the difference?"
"5c53ebea","Barbamon, Creepymon and Leviamon joined the city!"
"e186be3f","{0}, harbinger of peace for this world!
I am known as LordKnightmon, of the Royal Knights!"
"e286bf92","In accordance with my mission, I request a bout with you!"
"e386c105","The power that brought peace...is it really justice?
Or is it evil that would dominate?"
"dc86b600","Through battle, I can ascertain the truth!"
"dd86b7f3","Very well, let's fight!
I can't right now..."
"de86b966","Thank you for consenting! I'll come at you with all my
strength!"
"df86bad9","I see... I'll await the moment we can fight, and watch how
the world develops..."
"6ca75844","{0}... I've been waiting for you!"
"6fa75d1d","Today we battle, and through our bout, I can ascertain the
true nature of the power that brought peace to this world!"
"f52410f1","Now I see it... Indeed, what I felt from your power was
unmistakably justice..."
"f2240c38","I also felt your bond with the Digimon of this world..."
"f3240dab","Please, continue to protect the peace of this world...
When the time is right, you can count on my power!"
"f824154a","LordKnightmon joined the city!"
"fc701fd5","I'm Gomamon. If you're a fan of fishing, I'll listen to what
you have to say."
"fb701e62","Whew... The road of the collector is a demanding one..."
"fa701c8f","?"
"f9701b1c","My hobby is collecting Fishy Pictures! There's one I just
gotta add to my collection..."
"f87019a9","MegaSeadramon's Fishy Picture!"
"f7701836","Such a heroic figure reproduced in Fishy Picture form is
just too cool. Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps!"
"f6701643","That's where you come in... If you meet MegaSeadramon,
please get his Fishy Picture!"
"f57014d0","Sure!
Not interested in the least..."
"4702c4d","You'll do it for me?! You're the best!"
"3702ada","MegaSeadramon is at MOD Cape! Man, I just can't wait!"
"f66dd7ec","You don't get how cool Fishy Picture are?! Well...
FINE then..."
"55a648a1","MegaSeadramon's Fishy Picture! Ahh man, I can't wait for it!"
"52a643e8","MegaSeadramon is at MOD Cape! Man! Thanks for your help!"
"2bdd3634","Whoa-ho-ho!!! You brought me MegaSeadramon's Fishy Picture?!"
"2edd3a8d","You handed over the MegaSea Fishy Picture!"
"2ddd391a","Aww yeahhhhh!!! This is the Fishy Picture from MegaSeadramon
I've always dreamed of!"
"28dd317b","Oh man, oh jeez, this is just too cool! I can't believe I
got my hands on it!"
"27dd2f88","The paper on this Fishy Picture is a bit beat up...! Was
there some kinda battle or something?!"
"2add3441","I have to thank you somehow... Do you have anything you like
to collect?"
"29dd32ee","Huh?! You're gathering Digimon in the city?! Haha, I see,
I see! Guess I'll go join your collection!"
"24dd2acf","Gomamon joined the city!"
"89fb009e","Huh?! Stop... Don't talk to me..."
"89fb009f","I'm fine by myself... I like this spot..."
"8afb0271","Ahh...ahh...ACHOO!!! ...Shoot, you found me?"
"87fafdb8","Uh, are you alright?
(Pretend you didn't see anything...)"
"88faff2b","Brrrr... This pelt is just too worn-out... Cold wind just
pours in through the holes!"
"8dfb06ca","Garurumon gave it to me, so maybe he'd be willing to fix it.
You have any idea where he could be?"
"8efb08bd","(You talked about Garurumon.)"
"8bfb03e4","Oh... Garurumon's in the city? I'm actually a bit shy...so
I'm afraid to just ask. Still, better make the first move."
"8cfb0557","Gabumon joined the city!"
"81faf426","Oh...um, you okay...?"
"82faf599","Ahh...Ahhh...AHHHHHCHOOO!!! Ugh, it's absolutely freezing..."
"2f9ae667","Dead End Town was supposed to be here... What's going on
here?"
"2f9ae666","But it looks like the populace has been driven away. I hope
no one got hurt..."
"2e9ae4f4","Why hello there! ...You came from Floatia? In that case,
I've got something you might be able to help me with..."
"319ae94d","What's up?
Sorry, maybe next time."
"309ae7da","Swell, thanks a bunch!"
"2b9ae03b","I possess medical knowledge, you see, and the other day I
came across an injured Digimon..."
"2a9ade48","I was going to treat it, but it started going nuts and ran
off somewhere..."
"2d9ae301","If you see that Digimon, could you please check on the state
of its wounds?"
"2c9ae1ae","The Digimon in question is Hackmon, around Logic Volcano.
Thank you for your cooperation!"
"279ad98f","I see... I sure am worried..."
"a4b77eef","The wounded Hackmon is at Logic Volcano..."
"a5b78042","But be warned, if it goes on another rampage like before,
it won't listen to a word you say."
"fe2dcd22","Oh! It looks like you got to meet Hackmon! ...What?! You two
fought, and now it's heading to the city?!"
"fd2dcb4f","Is that right...? I guess it's feeling better now. But
still, I hope it doesn't have any new injuries!"
"fc2dc9dc","Right, I'll head to the city, too. There's lots of Digimon
there, so my medical training will surely be useful!"
"fb2dc869","Angemon joined the city!"
"655ef679","Lucemon joined the city!"
"70b36853","Finally we meet, {0}! I'm Lucemon!"
"71b369c6","I've been watching you ever since you arrived in this world!"
"72b36bb9","You humans are so interesting! Good and evil, black and
white, you guys sure like to put things in their place!"
"73b36d2c","Well, what do you think when you look at me?"
"74b36e9f","Does this appearance look virtuous? How exactly can you tell
stuff like that?!"
"75b37072","Now then...how about THIS appearance?!"
"9d028638","If I were to put it in human terms...my existence has
transcended concepts of good and evil!"
"a0028af1","I wonder how you'd try to define me?! Would you just use
black or white? Or...would you use ""good"" and ""evil""?!"
"9f02891e","What about yourself, human? Are you good? Are you evil?"
"a2028dd7","Pfft...HAHAHAHA! Come, fight me! And teach me how you humans
can tell the difference about all this stuff!!"
"46cc6225","HAHAHAHA! Have my words left you perplexed? I sensed some
hesitation in your battle."
"43cc5d6c","But I think you should know the answer..."
"44cc5edf","That strength of yours...lets me think of you as a force of
good!"
"41cc5a06","It is what has let you stay so pure...so good, has it not?"
"42cc5bf9","...Nothing to say in reply? Ho ho, very well...then I shall
prove my faith to you..."
"3fcc5720","Next time we meet, I'll turn everything you believe in
upside-down!"
"36c83cf0","Lucemon SM joined the city!"
"64764396","There you are, {0}! I've been watching you
since last time we met..."
"63764223","Every time I saw what you do in this world, my thoughts
would change into convictions..."
"627640b0","The thing that lets me think you as a force of good...its
foundation is undoubtedly that strength of yours!"
"69764bb5","That's the thing, yeah? No matter what reasons come your
way, you always arrive at a conclusion through battle..."
"687649c2","Your victorious strength is good, the defeated weak are
evil, as you've shown! Now I'll overrule that shallow proof!"
"6776486f","With this form embodying evil itself!"
"18f0fc75","If those with power to be victorious in battle are good..."
"15f0f7bc","Through victory, can I shed this mantle of sin and transform
into a good existence?"
"16f0f92f","Or instead...will I just add another sin to my tally?"
"13f0f456","Now then! Fight me, so I can find that answer for myself!"
"7bce4408","...Pff, ha ha ha! I see! So that's the answer, is it?!"
"7ece48c1","The thing that lets me think of you as a force of good...its
foundation was not the strength I first believed it to be!"
"7dce476e","Mixing a noble heart with wicked thoughts...moving forward,
clutching pain and anguish in your heart...that power!"
"80ce4c27","That in itself is your...no, humanity's power!
That's why you can think of yourself as good, isn't it?!"
"7fce4ab4","Jeez... You humans are just too interesting..."
"82ce4f0d","I'll keep watching you, as I always have...please show me
that power of yours again sometime..."
"449fdfc6","I still remember that flavor... Aw shoot, I'm drooling
again..."
"449fdfc7","It's zoning out too much to listen to you right now..."
"459fe1b9","...Hey, hey you! I have a tasty proposition for you, got a
second?!"
"429fdce0","Ooo, do tell!
Nah, no thanks..."
"439fde53","I knew you'd say that! When I said a tasty proposition, I
meant a chef that makes delicious dishes, you see."
"489fe672","The food that chef makes is always out of this world! I was
a regular at that restaurant..."
"499fe7e5","But...I don't know what that chef was thinking...he closed
his shop suddenly and went off somewhere..."
"469fe32c","So I want you to go looking for the chef yourself...I want
more tasty food, yeah? I want you to go order more!"
"479fe49f","The chef is Seraphimon. There are rumors of him being
spotted in Server Desert...so go for it!"
"4c9fecbe","What?! You don't like tasty propositions?!"
"feff19da","There are rumors of Seraphimon being in Server Desert!"
"fdff1867","I want you to ask him to make tasty food for me one more
time! I'm begging ya!"
"28c82c47","Huh? Really?! Seraphimon is gonna start cooking again?!"
"29c82e3a","This is fantastic! If I go to the restaurant in the city,
I can eat delicious cuisine again!"
"2ac82fad","I've gotta do it! I'll head to the city! This is all thanks
to you!"
"23c824a8","Ikkakumon joined the city!"
"e6af0ef4","...Oh! Digimon and a human, together... Ho ho, so you've
finally come my way."
"e6af0ef5","But right now, I'm taking on a request from someone else.
Sorry, but I can't help you at the moment."
"e7af1067","...Oh! Digimon and a human, together...ho ho, so you've
finally come my way."
"e7af1062","So, what do you want with me?"
"e8af11da","Where's Magnamon?
Nothing."
"e9af134d","Oh, you're looking for Magnamon, too? Yeah, I heard the same
thing from ExVeemon."
"e2af0848","I see... He's in a bad way, is he? You've actually come at a
good time."
"e3af0a3b","Magnamon...only appears in Server Desert on Fridays! That's
the last info I've gotten my hands on."
"e4af0bae","Jeez, he was supposed to be hard to find... Well, it looks
like my job here is done."
"e5af0d01","Now I can finally go to Floatia. Next I'll gather info on
your partner Digimon, heh heh."
"deaf021c","Veedramon joined the city!"
"dfaf038f","What?! You seriously don't want anything?"
"ecb156fd","Jeez... I figured it was an errand from ExVeemon...
Guess I'm just unlucky."
"12ea775d","The rules are simple! If you can beat me in 60 seconds..."
"11ea75ea","Hey! Are you that Tamer gathering residents for the city?"
"10ea7477","In that case, can you beat me if we follow some odd rules?"
"fea7284","The rules are simple! If you can beat me in 60 seconds..."
"eea7111","...I'll return to the city! So whaddaya think, interested?!"
"dea6fbe","Got it, let's fight!
Not right now, thanks."
"cea6dcb","Ooo, nice answer! Okay, bring it on!"
"bea6c58","...Jeez, I just wanted to fight a little. Man, forget about
it, then... I'll wait here until you change your mind!"
"4c206d89","You came to fight? All right, let me explain the rules one
more time!"
"49206930","If you can beat me in 60 seconds, I'll go live in the city!
So whaddaya think, interested?!"
"cc7254bc","...Too bad, time's up!"
"cf725975","With those skills, you couldn't beat me no matter HOW much
time I gave you!"
"ce725782","Well, feel free to come back and take me on any time!
I'll be waiting."
"d3a69ad3","Oooh noooo, I loooost!"
"d4a69c46","Anyone who can speedily beat someone as confident as me is
quite the tough customer!"
"d5a69e39","All right! I'll return to the city as promised! I look
forward to what happens there!"
"d6a69fac","GaoGamon joined the city!"
"9bf8a53b","Cherubimon joined the city!"
"371b59c2","..."
"371b59c3","No response..."
"381b5bb5","You there... I have judged you a hero of pure heart, and
find myself in need of your assistance..."
"351b56fc","What's wrong?
Sorry, can't right now."
"361b586f","I am Cherubimon...one of the beings known as Celestial
Digimon..."
"331b5396","Recently, I have felt a presence of tremendous evil oozing
from the Concealed Gorge ahead of here."
"341b5509","This presence grows by the day...and were it to break free,
mayhap it could cover this entire world..."
"311b50b0","And were a good Ultimate Digimon such as I to make contact with
this pure evil, I fear the corruption might infect me..."
"321b5223","That is why, pure-hearted hero...I need you to rout this
evil in my place!"
"3f1b66ba","At this rate, this world will become shrouded in evil..."
"afdfb3d6","The evil presence pouring out of the Concealed Gorge
ahead...it threatens to cover this entire world..."
"aedfb263","...Before that happens, I charge you to rout this evil!"
"8331aea3","The evil... It's disappeared..."
"8431b016","Thanks to you, the evil that threatened this world is gone."
"8531b189","Continue to watch over this world with your pure heart!"
"8631b37c","Cherubimon joined the city!"
"fe380b6b","Zzzzzz..."
"fe380b6a","It's sleeping so peacefully..."
"fd3809f8","Zzzzzz..."
"380eb1","...Who dares disturb my slumber? You would bring calamity
upon yourself..."
"ff380cde","I am Belphemon, one of the Seven Deadly Digimon. As you can
see, I am trying to sleep... Won't you let me be?"
"2381197","What's this? You wish to borrow the power of a Demon Lord?
If so we must fight, so I may see your power..."
"1381024","Then let's fight!
(Maybe I should back off for now...)"
"43814fd","Very well, I shall finish this quickly and return to sleep!"
"338130a","How wise. Now you shall not have to face such a calamity."
"d0e8ec13","...Oh? You wish to borrow the power of a Demon Lord after
all? If so, show me your power in battle... Quickly, now."
"d1e8ed86","I shall finish this at once, so I may return to my slumber!"
"c4947846","Hmm, very well, I acknowledge your strength. I suppose this
is all I can muster in sleep mode..."
"c39476d3","The Demon World we Seven Deadly Digimon reigned over has
been lost, and so I moved to this land."
"c2947560","I don't care where I am, as long as I can rest. The city,
you say? ...Hmph, might as well go there."
"c9948065","Belphemon SM joined the city!"
"8a5d0d46","Oh, aren't you--? You are that human, uh... Now what was it
again...?"
"895d0bd3","Master Gankoomon...I believe this one is designated as
{0}..."
"885d0a60","Yes, that's right! All right then, how about a friendly
battle?!"
"8f5d1565","Master Gankoomon...should we not first check and make sure
they have made the necessary preparations?"
"8e5d13f2","Let's get right to it!
I need a bit more time."
"8d5d121f","You're raring to go, as they say! Well then, we'll come at
full force!"
"8c5d10ac","We want to see what you've got when you're in tip-top shape.
Come on back when you're ready to go."
"6cca7ae5","Hey! You're back!"
"69ca762c","Let us begin. You need not hold back against Royal Knights
like us!"
"c3009ef8","Well done, well done indeed! You pass with flying colors!
Jesmon, you agree, don't you?!"
"c600a3b1","Yes, with this we can lend you our power without concern."
"c500a1de","Glad you think so, too. Now then, we'll go to the city.
I look forward to when we meet again!"
"c800a697","Gankoomon and Jesmon joined the city!"
"9aef38d7","Heh heh... Ha ha ha ha! Welcome to the first circle of the
underworld! ...Just kidding."
"9aef38d6","Infinite Cauldron is a special area made by reconstructing
deleted data..."
"9aef38d5","Data that's crumbled to dust reassembles over time. It's
like mixing everything in a big pot."
"99ef3764","Hmph... I imagine you're itching to go on ahead, but if you
want to pass, you'll have to defeat the Digimon before you."
"9cef3c3d","I bet you're thinking, ""it's just one opponent, what's the
big deal?"" ...Surprised? I can read your mind, buddy..."
"9bef3a4a","Oh ho, now you're thinking, ""Is this some kinda trap? Still,
I gotta keep going!"""
"96ef32ab","Heh heh... You wanna push on, despite worrying about the
potential traps... How reckless! Or should I call you brave?"
"95ef3138","We're coming through!
Let's wait and see for now..."
"98ef35f1","Fine, I'll see if that attitude of yours is bravery or just
plain foolishness! Come, my shadows!"
"97ef341e","...Heh, holding off, are ya? Thanks for making my job
easier!"
"2290bdf","Back again, are ya? Heh heh... You really are gonna try
braving the potential traps ahead..."
"3290db2","You think that makes you brave instead of careless?!"
"fccddd52","Ugh... What the--?!"
"fbcddbff","I don't get you humans at all. You act all reckless, but
it's...it's also like you're hiding something. But what?"
"facdda0c","Say what? I can find the answer in the city, you say? Heh,
don't get it twisted! I'm no ally of yours!　"
"f9cdd899","Devimon joined the city!"
"af99e02d","Well well, you're...never mind, I can't feel anything from
you."
"ae99deba","Well well, what do we have here? Human child...did you come
all the way here to see me?"
"ad99dcc7","Now now, hold on. I don't feel like fighting you... Won't
you listen to what I have to say?"
"ac99db54","Will you come to the city if I listen?
Not interested..."
"ea673619","My, but you do work quickly, don't you?"
"e7673140","The boy Shoma once asked me the same thing, you know."
"e8673333","...?!"
"ed673ad2","Still, he wasn't QUITE my type, you know? I play a little
hard-to-get, and he leaves without a word!"
"ee673c45","I hate being tied down, you know? I do what I want, the way
I want..."
"eb67378c","Hmm, let's see... Right now I feel like getting out of here
and doing something fun."
"ec67397f","That city of yours sounds like it could be fun enough to
entertain me..."
"f167411e","Still, I won't do anything I find tedious or boring."
"f26742f1","Well, if you let me run my own shop, I guess I could give it
a shot..."
"ef697caf","Is it a promise, child?"
"ee697b3c","I promise!
Umm... That's...not gonna happen..."
"f1697ff5","My my..."
"f0697e02","Ho ho! That's the nervous face I wanted to see."
"eb697663","Don't worry, I don't really care about running my own place."
"ea6974f0","I just wanted to see how interesting your city is by looking
at your reaction."
"ed697949","Of course, if there are some nice shops I might just up end
taking over, you know?"
"ec6977d6","Be sure to stop on by, hee hee..."
"f7698907","LadyDevimon joined the city!"
"de12c24c","Is that right? You're not as hospitable as I thought..."
"e112c705","You're just like all the others! I was wrong about you."
"7dadcb04","...You are not yet worthy of receiving my aid."
"7eadccf7","Ho ho, so you really did come. Just as I thought."
"7fadce6a","?"
"80adcfdd","I'm Paildramon. I heard rumors of you, and came here to wait
for you."
"79adc4d8","I wonder if you've heard of DNA Digivolution?"
"7aadc64b","It's when the power of two Digimon join as one through
Digivolution."
"7badc83e","If you have my strength, and the power of the Digivolution
Dojo, you can DNA Digivolve your partners."
"7cadc991","I'd like you to use this power well, for the sake of this
world. Still..."
"75adbeac","This power can be too strong. That's why I want to see if
you're the right person to wield it."
"76adc01f","Fret not. It won't be too difficult for someone like you."
"83b0130d","You'll have to fight and defeat me...but be warned. You'll
start with only 1/5 of your regular HP and MP."
"82b0119a","This will test your partner Digimons' powers, and your
ability to issue commands as their Tamer."
"81b01027","...Now then, shall we start?"
"80b00eb4","Let's do it!
Please give me a minute."
"7fb00cc1","Always ready to go, are you? How reliable. All right, here
we go!"
"7eb00b6e","If you lack confidence, go ahead and prepare a bit. Such
technique and power assessment are necessary Tamer skills."
"bd05ebdc","If you fight and defeat me...I'll help you out. But be
warned, you'll start with 1/5 of your regular HP and MP."
"c005f095","Have you made your preparations?"
"1cfe4129","Splendid, I was able to appraise you with my own eyes."
"19fe3c50","You of all people can wield my power...the power of DNA
Digivolution for the world. You should...no, you must!"
"1afe3dc3","You of all people can wield my power...the power of DNA
Digivolution for the world. You should...no, you must!"
"1ffe45e2","You'll have to use specific partner combinations to utilize
DNA Digivolution."
"20fe4755","Let me give you some Digivolution items that'll give you the
Digimon combo you need to test DNA Digivolution."
"1dfe429c","You got Dracocursite!"
"1dfe4299","You got Frumentadgressite!"
"1efe440f","Oh...it looks like you can't hold anymore items. Sorry, but
please free up some space in your inventory."
"23fe4c2e","Now then, I'll see you in the city."
"24fe4d81","Paildramon joined the city!"
"36dd24cc","ARE YOUUU A HUUUMAN...?!"
"39dd2985","HMM...I HAVE NOT SEEN YOUUU BEFORE...WHY ARE YOUUU HERE?"
"38dd2812","Let me explain.
I can't tell you."
"33dd2073","I WAS BEATEN BY A DIFFERENT HUUUMAN FROM YOUUU, 
AND WOUUUND UP HERE."
"32dd1e80","MAYBE THAT HUUUMAN IS FURTHER AHEAD IN THIS AREA. YOUUU
WOULD GO TO DEFEAT THEM, WOULDN'T YOUU."
"35dd2359","IN THAT CASE...YOUUU AND I HAVE THE SAME GOAL. BUT DON'T
THINK I CAN TRUST WHAT YOUUU SAY JUST LIKE THAT..."
"34dd21e6","IF WHAT YOUUU SAY IS TRUE...THEN I MUUUST TEST YOUUU FIRST
IN BATTLE!"
"3fdd3317","HUUUMAN...YOUUU ARE INDEED UUUNTRUUUSTWORTHY."
"32dd1e85","HUUUH? YOUUU ALREADY DEFEATED THAT HUUUMAN...YOUUU SAY?"
"35dd235c","WHEN IN THE WORLD...ARE YOUUU SERIOUS?"
"b12e1d27","HMPH, I UUUNDERSTAND. YOUUU DO NOT LIE."
"a92e104f","I STAYED HERE TO FIGHT THAT OTHER HUUUMAN ONCE AGAIN, BUT..."
"b63063bd","I FEEL SO REFRESHED AFTER FIGHTING YOUUU! MAYBE I'LL GO AND
CHECK OUUUT FLOATIA."
"b53061ca","Okuwamon joined the city!"

yet to settle into place."

"4cd6e0f0","My name is Sakuyamon. I have awoken for the first time in
centuries, and fear I am confused..."
"4dd6e263","I want to go to a place called Floatia. Could you guide me
there?"
"52d6ea02","That is Taomon's Taoist charm, is it not? Use it, and
boom..."
"53d6ebf5","I cannot use it myself.
Sorry, I have something to do."
"50d6e73c","Oh my, is that so? Very well, I'll ask the 'mon himself..."
"51d6e8af","Hello, can you hear me? ...Hey, wai--tch, how rude, Taomon!"
"56d6f04e","...Huh? An explanation? Umm... All right, all right...
I suppose I must."
"57d6f221","Grrr, FINE then, I'll go myself."
"d4d9f55f","Huh, you think that guy has his doubts about me...?"
"15a0edaa","That Taomon is being a real pain. I can't understand him at
all."
"14a0ec37","C'mon, use that Taoist charm, just a little!"
"930de197","Heh heh, sorry! Taomon's doubting me for some reason..."
"940de30a","You guys have proven it to me: times may change, but narrow-
mindedness doesn't..."
"950de4fd","He and I are from the same school of thought, you know..."
"8e0dd9f8","Huh? I'm talking too much? Fine, fine. Well, I've finally
gotten permission, so I'll head to the city."
"8f0ddb6b","Sakuyamon joined the city!"
"85b0e289","WHO ARE YOU? A HUMAN?! THIS INFINITE CAULDRON IS GETTING
ODDLY FULL..."
"85b0e288","BUT NO, I HAVE NO DESIRE TO LEAVE THIS PLACE IN PURSUIT OF
ADVENTURE..."
"84b0e116","WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT?"
"83b0dfa3","I have a letter from Stingmon!
Sorry, wrong guy--er, Digimon."
"82b0de30","You handed over Stingmon's Letter!"
"89b0e935","THIS IS FROM STINGMON...? LET'S SEE HERE... HMM, HMM..."
"88b0e742","UGH... THIS GUY... *sniff*..."
"87b0e5ef","HEY, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?! I'M NOT CRYING!
YOU'RE CRYING!"
"86b0e47c","I CAME TO INFINITE CAULDRON AND LOST TRACK OF TIME
EXPLORING..."

WHAT A BLUNDER ON MY PART."

HAVEN'T SEEN SUNLIGHT IN A WHILE NOW...　"

THE EXPLORATION OF THIS AREA TO YOU.　"

"81ae9de6","...THE WRONG DIGIMON?"
"82ae9f59","THEN WHY DID YOU CALL OUT TO ME? WHAT A WEIRDO..."
"8fee0460","Restarting...initiating self-recovery...2%...2%...2%..."
"8fee0461","It sounds like our question isn't getting through to it..."
"90ee05d3","Urgh... Sorry, but...
Would you lend me your help?"
"91ee0746","Sure, what's wrong?
Sorry, can't right now."
"92ee0939","First, let me name myself... I am MegaGargomon..."
"93ee0aac","I chased a certain Digimon from the other-dimensional
Digital World..."
"94ee0c1f","That Digimon is RustTyranomon! I drove him off just before
annihilated our world... He is destruction personified..."
"95ee0df2","After a fierce battle, we drove it to a dimensional rift...
But he broke through it, and came to this world!"
"96ee0f65","I chased after him, and just when I was about to finish him
off, I somehow found myself in this world..."
"97ee10d8","But...before my energy runs out...please...take him out...!"
"98ee124b","Left to his own devices, he may destroy this world, too!
I want you to destroy that Digimon before this happens!"
"95f04c69","Ugh.. At this rate...my...my energy..."
"bd3d23b8","Left to his own devices, RustTyranomon could also bring this
world to ruin!"
"c03d2871","If you want to defeat him, you have to do it now, while he's
wounded! Do whatever it takes to beat him!"
"6706ffa5","Oh! You defeated RustTyranomon?!"
"6406faec","Thank goodness, the threat against this world has passed...
How lucky that I met you first."
"6506fc5f","I must repay the favor... Oh yes, you're gathering comrades,
aren't you?!"
"6206f786","In that case, let me lend you my power. I'll try looking for
a way back to my own world."
"6306f979","MegaGargomon joined the city!"
"f4d69c3b","Is that...a human?!"
"f4d69c3a","Ugh...no, I can't...how could I rely on a human..."
"f3d69a48","Please, you there... I need your help..."
"f6d69f01","?!"
"f5d69dae","I am known as MagnaAngemon..."
"f8d6a267","I sensed a great number of malicious beings, and answering
the summons to purify evil, came to this world."
"f7d6a0f4","Faced with the wicked power drifting in the Infinite
Cauldron...my body was ruined by the interdimensional trip."
"fad6a54d","My energy has been exhausted, to the point where I don't
even have strength to escape from this Infinite Cauldron..."
"f9d6a3da","Thus, I must ask you...in order to refill my energy, would
you bring me a Large Double Disk?"
"ecd68f43","You got it!
Maybe later?"
"ebd68dd0","...You have my thanks! As things stand, my body is going to
disappear... Please, you must help me!!!"

Before my power...is spent...!"

Cauldron, I need you to bring me a Large Double Disk!"

I can't give you one yet..."
"6bda7f0","You handed over one Large Double Disk!"
"dbdb2f5","...Ohhh! I was almost out of time! Now, I shall use it at
once..."
"cbdb102","*whew* You just barely saved me... Now I can escape from
this Infinite Cauldron..."
"bbdafaf","Still... I lack the power to purify this world... Could I,
perhaps, leave that task to you?"
"abdae3c","In exchange...I will stay in this world and help you any way
I can..."
"11bdb921","Yes...I understand now! This must be the true reason
I was summoned to this world!"
"10bdb74e","MagnaAngemon joined the city!"
"3bb6440","I see...but I will ask you next time... At this rate, my
power will soon expire!"
"4df981d2","...!"
"4df981d3","It ran off in an instant! Talk about a speedy 'mon!"
"4ef98345","Oh, human child... Somehow I have appeared in this world..."
"4bf97e8c","I am Phoenixmon. I erase the evil of the world with holy
power, and protect this proper, beautiful Digital World."
"4cf9807f","From what I can tell...the appearance of you humans upset
the balance of this world."
"49f97ba6","In other words...as long as you humans are in this world,
we will not be able to rid this world of evil..."
"4af97d19","Not all humans are evil!
Maybe you're right..."
"47f97840","In other words, you consider yourself to be good?
Then let us fight, and prove this to me!"
"48f97a33","If you think so, then leave this world at once!"
"3044f1a6","Oh child...you yet remain in this world? How many times must
I say this to you?"
"2f44f033","As long as you humans are in this world, we will not be
able to rid this world of evil!"
"aff30af3","Oh child...you certainly appear to be a force of good. The
true nature of man may be good, just as I am."
"b0f30c66","But...in time, that good may be steeped in vice. Still, you
are free from such corruption."
"b1f30dd9","As long as you continue to be a force of good, there may be
a single ray of hope that eliminates evil from this world."
"b2f30f4c","I am one that loves goodness and beauty... I maintain a
beautiful soul. Oh human child, I will keep watch over you."
"b3f3113f","Phoenixmon joined the city!"
"1caabd55","Hrrrrn...harummmmm..."
"1caabd54","It appears to have just woken up...it doesn't look like it
can see you..."
"1baabbe2","Are you a Tamer? Ho...you've got some nerve, calling out
to me..."
"1aaaba0f","I am VenomMyotismon. As I am now, I tremble with the urge to
slaughter and destroy..."
"19aab89c","The only thing that can quench this thirst-like urge is
maddeningly violent battle!"
"18aab729","Well?! Will you fight with me, and satisfy my lust for
violence?!"
"17aab5b6","Okay...but I won't lose!
(Let's get out of here...)"
"16aab3c3","That is the right answer, Tamer! Satisfy me with the
seething blood of battle!"
"15aab250","Ho...so you would turn your back on me in fear...?"
"75e0e621","So you've returned, Tamer... You will fight me this time,
won't you?!"
"72e0e168","Fight me, and satisfy my overwhelming thirst for destruction
and death!"
"4c17d3b4","...Ho. That was the fierce combat I wanted!"
"4f17d80d","Still...the stronger you are, the stronger my urge becomes.
If this power erupts, even I will return to nothing..."
"4e17d69a","I don't want that... I've already got my eye on a place
where I can suppress this power. I'll head there now!"
"4917cefb","VenomMyotismon joined the city!"
"1c15bbf","Hmmm, Digimon from this world, and...a human...yes?"
"2c15d12","Turn back, if you don't want to die."
"3c15e85","You'll die eventually either way, so I guess it doesn't
really matter."
"fcc15380","Bzz...zzz...zzzt... This noise in my electronic brain...
Damn that MegaGargomon..."
"fdc15573","I'll defeat you, RustTyranomon!
(Let's get out of here for now...)"

seconds...bzz...!"

"8ce1f5c4","You...death awaits you regardle--URGH... This noise...
what the...?"
"8fe1fa9d","Is it because my electronic brain is incomplete...? Curses!"
"155eae71","Rebooting... Rebooting... Reboot complete."
"125ea9b8","Where am I? What...who are you...? My memory banks...have
been wiped?"
"135eab2b","Tch...my rampage factor...has been auto-deleted... that was
the source of my directive to rampage until the world's end?"
"185eb2ca","Who put that there...and why? I don't know... Ugh... That
is...dimensional interference...? Should I head towards it?"
"195eb4bd","RustTyranomon joined the city!"
"f795db5c","...'re you? ...ere is this...?"
"f795db5d","You can't make out its words. Looking closely, its body is
all blurry..."
"f895dccf","A human... Wait, there are two Digimon with you...a Tamer?!"
"f995dea2","What a rare meeting! By all means, I'd like to request a
match with you..."
"fa95e015","Oh, I still haven't said my name... It's Agunimon! I've been
traveling to Digital Worlds looking for strong opponents!"
"f395d510","I've just come to this world, so what do you say? Please
fight me!"
"f495d683","I'll do it!
Sorry, can't right now..."
"f595d876","Thank you so much! Show me the power of your two partner
Digimon!"
"f695d9e9","That is a true shame... I'll go look for another opponent..."
"905c0854","Yo! Come to accept my challenge, have you?"
"935c0d2d","I waited here hoping you'd come back! So, are you willing to
fight now?!"
"ad7f89c1","I see... How exceptional! I mean, your partners are strong,
but that's not all..."
"aa7f8508","The most amazing thing is the unity between Digimon and
Tamer! It's like your partners can read your mind!"
"ab7f86fb","People like you are what make this world all the more
interesting... I think I'll stick around for a while!"
"b07f8e9a","Agunimon joined the city!"
"11a4db44","I am a member of the Holy Knight order known as the Royal
Knights. Call me Dynasmon!"
"14a4e01d","{0}, the Tamer who saved this world!
What is the real reason those two Digimon follow you?"
"13a4deaa","Loyalty derived from majesty? Or perhaps control by force?"
"ea4d68b","Would you fight me, and let me determine this for myself?"
"da4d518","If that's what you want, then let's fight!
I can't right now..."
"10a4d9d1","You've done me a great service in accepting my request!
I shall ascertain the true will of your partners!"
"fa4d87e","Too bad... Still, I shall remain here as long as it takes!"
"8684413f","Oh {0}, the Tamer commanding two Digimon..."
"87844292","Would you fight me, and let me determine the true meaning
behind these two Digimon following you?"
"3feb69b2","The reason those two Digimon follow you is neither loyalty,
nor forced dominion, it would seem..."
"3eeb67df","Nor is it the devotion I pledged to King Drasil. ...I see.
This is what they call a Bond!"
"3deb666c","What a fascinating relationship! I will continue to watch
over this Bond of yours!"
"3ceb64f9","Dynasmon joined the city!"
"5951f56b","You...the Tamer that saved this world! I see...you have the
same eyes as the Tamer who once guided me..."
"5a51f6de","Oh yes, my name...I'm Imperialdramon!"
"5b51f8b1","I once saved an other-dimensional Digital World from crisis,
using a bond with a Tamer much like yourself..."
"5c51fa24","When I came to this world, I heard rumors about you, and
grew interested in seeing your power with my own eyes..."
"5d51fb97","How about it? Do you think I could ask you for a fight?"
"5e51fd0a","If that's what you want!
Can we do it next time...?"
"5f51fefd","I'm grateful to you! Now then, neither of us should hold
back! Let's give it all we've got!"
"5051e700","That's too bad, but don't worry about it... I can be a bit
selfish. I await the next opportunity..."
"8b5d1bf0","You came back...savior of this world! You really do share
the same eyes as the Tamer who once guided me..."
"8e5d2049","Allow me to introduce myself once more... Please call me
Imperialdramon!"
"a8cb0b9d","I see... So that is the power that saved this world! Not
only that, but you came at me at full force, as I asked..."
"a5cb06c4","It would be rude of me not to meet that sincerity with my
own full strength!"
"a6cb08b7","Now then! Next I will unleash my full power, and change from
this dragon form...into Fighter Mode!"
"92ad7582","I didn't expect you to have this much strength... You have
far exceeded my imagination!"
"91ad742f","Damn... You are quite the fascinating Tamer... In this case,
I must request one final battle..."
"90ad72bc","This is my final form, one said to the founder of the Royal
Knights... Please fight with my Paladin Mode!"
"65940f4f","I thank you from the bottom of my heart for going so far to
accept my requests!"
"66941122","You are indeed a true Tamer, one of bravery and justice. You
also show unlimited trust and affection to your partners!"
"67941295","Thanks to you, for the first time in ages I was able to
recall my wonderful time together with my former Tamer."
"60940790","I cannot be happier to have met a Tamer like you! I hope we
meet again, and have another chance to fight!"
"61940903","Imperialdramon joined the city!"
"c02ac44a","...Who're you?"
"bf2ac2d7","You came here to play with me?"
"be2ac164","Give back ToyAgumon's block!
I don't have time to play."
"bd2abff1","Nope, nothin' doin'."
"bc2abe1e","This's a present from my friend."
"bb2abcab","This's my treasure."
"ba2abb38","So no, nothin' doin'."
"b92ab945","(You talked about how ToyAgumon can't move.)"
"b82ab7d2","Huh? Whaddaya mean?"
"bb287e34","This block came poppin' out when me and ToyAgumon were
playing, so I took it."
"bc287fa7","S true, he hasn't come play fer a while, but..."
"bd28811a","I had no idea that'd happened. Sorry..."
"be28828d","Yeah, 'm sorry. Just 'cause my face don't change, don't mean
I ain't sorry."
"b7287788","You got the ToyAgu Block!"
"b828797b","Hey, you, let's be friends. I'm goin' to the city. See ya."
"b9287aee","Monzaemon joined the city!"
"ba287c41","If ya can't, ya can't."
"7a6185e9","?"
"77618110","Who're you? Come ta play?"
"78618283","Give back ToyAgumon's block!
I don't have time to play."
"7d618aa2","Oh, that's kinda outta da blue. No way."
"7e618c15","Maybe sumfin else...huhhh? You ain't got no space for
items, do ya?"
"7b61875c","I won't play if yer items are full like that."
"7c6188cf","If ya can't, ya can't."
"dc36ef72","Whew... This isn't nearly enough energy..."
"db36ed9f","What to do, what to d--hmm?"
"da36ec2c","Oh! Are you one of those...yeah, you're a human!"
"d936eab9","They call me EmperorGreymon. For reasons I cannot go into,
I'm trying to gather up energy."
"d836e8c6","Said energy can be refined through several means, but all of
them take too much time."
"d736e753","My comrade MagnaGarurumon is gathering materials for me, but
there's not nearly enough..."
"d636e5e0","Want some help?
Good luck with that..."
"e536fd5d","What...?! I can't tell you why I'm doing this, but...you'll
help me anyway?!"
"e436fbea","Are all humans like you? No, perhaps this is a special trait
only you possess. I can see it in your eyes."
"5733df7c","If that's the case, then I'll give you the benefit of the
doubt. The truth is, this energy is for reviving Susanomon."
"5833e0ef","Susanomon, a slumbering thunder god of war. When the world
faces peril, he is to revive and swing his righteous blade."
"5933e242","...Or so they say. But some unknown outside force blocks the
energy he needs to awaken from his sleep."
"5a33e435","That's why we've devised a way to force Susanomon to revive--
by gathering energy on our own."
"5333d930","I have mastered a method of refining energy. What I need
from you are objects to refine into said energy."
"5433daa3","We need ten types of energy to revive him: fire, light,
ice, wind, lightning, dark, earth, wood, water and steel."
"5533dc16","We already have a few of these. MagnaGarurumon is off to
retrieve them."
"5633dd89","What we lack are wood, wind and earth types."
"5f33ebd4","First is...wood.
Bring me some ivy from the Palace of Thorns."
"6033ed47","The ivy is on the southern wall of the Palace of Thorns in
Ohguino. Get it while it's moist, before noon."
"e93b80d7","I leave it to you!"
"e83b7f64","You found moist ivy."
"eb3b843d","Pick
Don't pick"
"ea3b824a","You got Thorny Ivy!"
"366d19b1","Did you bring the Thorny Ivy from the south side of the
Palace of Thorns in Ohguino Wastelands?"
"336d14f8","Not yet, huh? Do your best. It's on the southern wall of the
Palace of Thorns and you need to pick it before noon."
"346d166b","You handed over the Thorny Ivy."
"396d1e0a","There's no doubt about it. These are exactly what we need."
"3a6d1ffd","With these we can do something about that wood energy...well
done, human."
"376d1b24","Right, next up we'll need materials for wind energy..."
"386d1c97","I need a Speed Chip. They're precious items, and no matter
what we do we're just one short."
"2d6d0b66","Sorry for such an troublesome task, but I'm relying on you."
"adf06104","Did you bring the Speed Chip I require?"
"b0f065dd","Hmm, looks like you're still empty-handed. I know it's a
rare item to get your hands on, but I beg you..."
"aff0646a","You handed over one Speed Chip."
"aaf05c4b","Ohhh, you've done us a great service."
"a9f05ad8","Now things are looking up with regards to the wind energy.
You have my thanks!"
"acf05f91","Now then, last but not least is the earth energy material..."
"abf05e3e","In order to make earth energy, we'll need the life force of
a Digimon."
"a6f0561f","Give your partner more than 8,000 HP!"
"a5f054ac","Once you've raised one of your partner's HP to 8,001 or
higher, come on back here."
"28ed510e","Oh wow, you've already raised your partner's HP past 8,000!"
"29ed52e1","If it's all right with you, I'll transfer that HP into this
container right away. What say you?"
"26ed4e28","Submit the HP (won't affect max HP).
Don't do it for now."
"27ed4f9b","Hmm...I guess now's a bad time. Whenever you're ready,
please submit the 8,000 HP we need."
"2ced57ba","Fantastic, thank you! Now then, without further ado...!"
"2ded592d","Hmph... Haaaah!"
"2aed5454","8,000 HP was transferred from {1}."
"2bed55c7","8,000 HP was transferred from {2}."
"20ed4496","All right...this is it! Now we've got the earth energy."
"21ed4609","Hmph... Now all that's left is to await my partner
MagnaGarurumon's return!"
"22eb0905","But hmm... My comrade is a bit late... I wonder if it ran
into any trouble..."
"21eb0792","Sorry to ask more of you, but could you go and look for
MagnaGarurumon?"
"20eb063f","And if there's some sort of trouble...please take care of
it. I leave it to you!"
"1feb044c","MagnaGarurumon is looking for objects to make dark and
steel energy."
"1eeb02d9","He's probably in a place where the Digimon are real tough...
Does any place come to mind?"
"ea4e9b9b","Are you ready? I need 8,000 HP."
"eb4e9d0e","I see, so you're still not ready... Do what you can to raise
that HP."
"ec4e9ee1","You have more than 8,000 HP! Are you ready to help me out?"
"c085892e","What is it? Have you found MagnaGarurumon?"
"bf8587bb","I see, you still haven't found it... Well, please keep up
the search. Look in a place with lots of tough Digimon."
"be8585c8","You were able to meet MagnaGarurumon? ...I see, so the
energy materials were entrusted to you, were they?"
"c58590cd","Then please, give them to me at once!"
"c4858f5a","You handed over all ten Supermassive Machine Parts."
"c3858de7","You don't have enough Supermassive Machine Parts"
"c2858c74","Hmm...this isn't enough for our needs. Could you go retrieve
the remaining objects we need to make steel energy?"
"b9857e29","What a haul! We'll have no problem making steel energy
we need with all this."
"b8857cb6","Now then, all we need now is the dark energy...we've almost
got it all lined up. Let's go meet up with MagnaGarurumon!"
"b8311b8d","Hmm? Oh, it's you!!!"
"b5311734","Sorry to keep you waiting, Emperor!"
"b63118a7","I had to rely on {0} to get the job done."
"b33113ee","The base materials for the dark energy are incredible...
I couldn't do anything about them on my own."
"b4311541","I see, you had to divvy up the labor this time, huh?"
"b1311088","Go on, {0}, give him what you got."
"b231127b","You handed over all twenty Ultramassive Dark Matters."
"af310da2","These are really something...even if you can find some,
transporting them is a different story."
"b0310f15","But with this...we've finally gotten our hands on all ten
types of energy!"
"9d332fe3","Time to refine the dark energy! Nnngwoooooh!"
"9c332e70","Oh!"
"9f3332c9","It's finished...and now we have everything we need!"
"9e333156","It's time...to insert them into our bodies!"
"a133362f","?!"
"a03334bc","..."
"a3333975","EmperorGreymon...MagnaGarurumon...you did it!"
"a2333782","And you as well, Tamer..."
"a5333c5b","I'll wait for you at Logic Volcano...!"
"a4333ae8","..."
"2b2bc0a8","..."
"2c2bc21b","...Uh, ugggh...?"
"2d2bc38e","We succeeded!"
"2e2bc561","Whew...I feel so refreshed."
"2f2bc6d4","Did we surprise you? Our combination was the final key for
restoring Susanomon's form."
"302bc847","We succeeded somehow, and materialized Susanomon. With
this, our role is complete."
"312bca3a","Shall we go, partner?"
"322bcbad","That's right... We've decided, Tamer. We're going to help
take care of your city."
"232bb430","We'll lend our strength for the sake of the city from now
on. See you there!"
"242bb5a3","MagnaGarurumon joined the city!"
"b12ed211","Yeah, let's do it! Oh, give our best to Susanomon."
"b02ed0be","EmperorGreymon joined the city!"
"cd883a0f","Oh, what have we here?"
"ce883be2","My name is MagnaGarurumon."
"cf883d55","I see, so EmperorGreymon... now I get it."
"c8883250","Good timing, actually. There's something I want...no, a task
I simply must ask of you."
"c98833c3","I'm already looking for objects that can act as materials
for steel and dark energies in this area."
"ca8835b6","Still, it'll take a bit of time to retrieve them. And so
that's why..."
"cb883729","I want you to carry what I produce over to EmperorGreymon."
"d4884574","It's a little bit of a pain...how do I put this...there's
quite a lot."
"d58846e7","If we don't gather up a certain amount, they'll decompose as
soon as we leave this area, rendering them useless."
"d28a8085","You need ten free item slots for these."
"d18a7f12","You don't have enough room, do you? If you're gonna take my
request, free up ten item slots."
"d08a7dbf","It looks like you have enough room now. Will you help a 'mon
out?"
"cf8a7bcc","I'll take them.
Not quite yet..."
"ce8a7a59","You got Supermassive Machine Parts A through J."
"cd8a78e6","Give these to EmperorGreymon in Server Tower as soon as you
can. Susanomon's revival rests on your shoulders!"
"cc8a7773","I see...but I can only rely on you. Please don't forget!"
"cb8a7580","Are you ready?"
"da8a8d7d","You have ten item slots ready to go. Can you take on this
task now?"
"918d7694","Did you deliver the Supermassive Machine Parts to
EmperorGreymon?"
"948d7b6d","Fantastic! Next on the list is...well, we've got another
amazing thing on our hands."
"938d79fa","The objects we need to make dark energy...Ultramassive Dark
Matter."
"8e8d71db","It may look small at first glance, but it contains a vast
amount of highly condensed data."
"8d8d7068","As for the amount...they take up 40 item slots!"
"908d7521","I'll need you to carry half--20 in all. I'll take the rest.
This is the last thing I'll ask of you!"
"8f8d734e","So will you do it?"
"8a8d6baf","When you're ready, come back with 20 free item slots."
"898d6a3c","I'll take them.
Not quite yet..."
"8c8b301e","You got Ultramassive Dark Matter A through T."
"8d8b31f1","Okay, give these to EmperorGreymon in Server Tower! I'll
hurry on over myself!"
"8a8b2d38","Are you ready?"
"8b8b2eab","You have 20 item slots ready to go. Can you take on this
task now?"
"12d64984","Hey there! You're one of those...whatchamacallems..."
"15d64e5d","Uhhh, whaddaya call 'em again? Ahhh never mind..."
"14d64cea","Anyways, you're the one taking on requests from us Digimon,
ain'tcha?"
"fd644cb","In thaaat case, how about one for lil' ole me? Please?
Pretty please?!"
"ed64358","I wanna send a gift to my buddy, see."
"11d64811","Please give this to Dianamon!"
"10d646be","You got a Red Gift Box."
"bd63e9f","Dianamon is somewhere in Absolute Zero...I think?"
"ad63d2c","Come back when you're done and tell me how she likes it!"
"8dd3398e","Go go go!"
"8ed33b61","Waaaait a sec, where're you gonna put this? Free up some
space, why don't ya!"
"8bd336a8","Oh, all ready to go?"
"5b769e7f","Hey hey hey! Did you give Dianamon what I asked you to?"
"5c769fd2","I wonder if she liked it?"
"5d76a145","You conveyed Dianamon's response."
"56769640","Huh? No reaction whatsoever?"
"57769833","That's weird... I put Dianamon's favorite thing in there..."
"587699a6","Huh? You got a letter...?"
"59769b19","You handed over Dianamon's letter."
"6276a964","Hmmm, let's see here..."
"6376aad7","Dearest...verily...forsooth? Uhhhhh...."
"6078e4f5","What's with all this old-timey speech?! I can't read it at
all!"
"5f78e302","Man... What the heck is this?"
"5e78e1af","Hey, can I ask you one more favor?"
"5d78e03c","You got a Green Gift Box."
"5c78de49","Come back again and tell me what she says!"
"5b78dcd6","Huh? You forgot the present from Dianamon?
Hurry up and bring it!"
"411cd7f2","Oh, you're back! Sorry for all the errands."
"401cd61f","I bet Dianamon was happy as a clam this time!"
"3f1cd4ac","You conveyed Dianamon's response."
"3e1cd339","Huh? Still nothing? Did you get anything in return?"
"3d1cd146","You handed over the Blue Gift Box."
"3c1ccfd3","Ahhh yeah, lookit this lame packaging...this's from Dianamon
all right..."
"3b1cce60","Let's take a look inside..."
"4a1ce5dd","Say what?!"
"491ce46a","What's this? Water? I'm soaked to the bone here!"
"bc19c7fc","Grr..."
"bd19c96f","Daaaah! Now I'm pissed!!!"
"be19cac2","Dianamon, you jerk!"
"bf19ccb5","Minervamon ran off in a huff."
"b819c1b0","Hmmm, what about the present from Dianamon?
It doesn't look like you have it."
"b16ea6c1","Well look what we have here...a human."
"ae6ea208","Don't act so friendly...did you need something from me?"
"af6ea3fb","A present from Minervamon...?"
"b46eab9a","You gave the Red Gift Box to Dianamon."
"b56ead0d","This box design...there's no doubt about where it came from.
Now, let's see what's inside."
"b26ea8b4","...Huh?!"
"b36eaa27","..."
"a86e98f6","Thanks for bringing this, {0}."
"a96e9a69","Are you going to see Minervamon again? You see, I want to
give something in return, but..."
"b670ed57","Unfortunately I don't have anything on me. Would you deliver
a handwritten letter from me instead?"
"b570ebe4","Dianamon wrote a letter."
"b870f0bd","You got Dianamon's letter."
"b770eeca","Please make sure Minervamon reads it with your own eyes,
okay?"
"b270e72b","A present from Minervamon for me?
But it doesn't look like you've got it with you."
"299e6002","Welcome back, human."
"289e5eaf","So how did it go?"
"279e5d3c","You conveyed Minervamon's response."
"269e5b49","Ho... So that's how it is, huh?"
"259e59d6","What's this? Another present?"
"249e5863","...Guess I'd better take it."
"239e56f0","You gave the Green Gift Box to Dianamon."
"329e6e6d","Another one of these, huh..."
"319e6cfa","..."
"249c198c","...Thanks again."
"259c1b7f","This time I have something ready to go. Please take this
back with you."
"269c1cd2","You got a Blue Gift Box."
"279c1e45","Make sure you see how much Minervamon enjoys it."
"209c1340","Huh?
It looks like maybe you forgot something..."
"fc84f9cf","Graaaaaaah, Dianamoooooon!"
"fd84fba2","My, you didn't waste any time getting over here, did you?"
"fe84fd15","What the heck was that water about?!"
"f784f210","Water? ...Oh, right."
"f884f383","I carved you an ice sculpture. I thought you'd like it."
"f984f576","But yes, I guess it'd melt if you took it to Logic Volcano."
"fa84f6e9","There it is, that dang tricky nature of yours! I bet ya used
all those highfalutin words in that letter to embarrass me!"
"3850534","Hmph, you sent me that gift in the first place, didn't you?"
"48506a7","Say what? I sent yer favorite Jaguar Potatoes. You once ate
so many steamed potatoes you almost passed out, right?!"
"1874045","Don't say that! That was just an accident!"
"873ed2","Then I sent those Cobb Fruit you love so much! Remember that
time you ate so much salted cobb you got sick--"
"ff873d7f","Shut up already!"
"fe873b8c","*sigh* ...Enough with the fair maiden act. I know you want
people to think you're cool and all..."
"fd873a19","*sigh* ...To think there's such a blockhead within the
Olympos XII... I simply cannot take it..."
"fc8738a6","Yer just an ingrate, Dianamon! Between the two of us, I'm
the one that's got my act more together!"
"fb873733","C'mon now...friends shouldn't fight.
I don't get what's going on, but...I'm sorry.
Uhh...so can I go, or...?"
"fa873540","Hush up, you!"
"9874d3d","Don't tell me you're taking Minervamon's side?"
"8874b4a","We'll shut that mouth of yours...AND those eyes...by force!"
"789884e","We'll have you forget everything you've seen here..."
"8898a21","???!!!"
"224e0670","Hmph, what'd you come here for?!"
"254e0ac9","How impertinent..."
"3fbbf61d","Aaaaugh, we give up!"
"3cbbf144","What in the world were we doing?"
"3dbbf337","Before I knew it, we came at full force..."
"3abbee7e","That's right...we combined forces to take them on..."
"3bbbefd1","Man, all the blood went straight to my head!"
"38bbeb18","Hmph...same here..."
"39bbec8b","Yer a tough one, {0}."
"36bbe832","Forgive us, human...you had nothing to do with all this, and
yet we got you caught up in our affairs."
"37bbe9a5","But still, it was kinda fun, wasn't it? It was a great
workout, at any rate."
"24be0a73","Indeed. Hostility makes free time unbearable, and you cannot
enjoy such levity. Don't you agree, Minervamon?"
"23be0880","Ah...yeah, I guess you're right. Idle hands are the
Devimon's playthings!"
"26be0d59","Hmm. Actually, I have an idea."
"25be0be6","Oh! I know, you wanna head over to Floatia, right?"
"28be10bf","Indeed. It seems quite ""fun,"" as you would say."
"27be0ecc","All right then, let's do it!"
"2abe1385","Minervamon joined the city!"
"29be1212","How honest. I guess that's one of Minervamon's good points."
"2cbe16eb","Oh...um, feel free to forget all that stuff about my
favorite foods, okay?"
"2bbe1578","Dianamon joined the city!"
"45d696ae","Hrrrm...maybe if I add a twist here...and speed up my steps
by 0.2 seconds..."
"44d6953b","Huh...? You're a human... So, what do you want from me?"
"43d69348","Oh...right! You know BanchoLeomon, don't you?"
"4ad69e4d","He mentioned you before, yes he did. Said he'd take up
residence in the city."
"49d69cda","You must be the one going around inviting Digimon to that
city."
"48d69b67","BanchoLeomon is my rival... It stings a little that you
talked to me second..."
"47d699f4","But it really doesn't matter that much to me."
"3ed68ba9","What matters is whether or not I can defeat my rival in a
duel!"
"3dd68a36","Once I achieve that, I'll join you in your city."
"40d45018","In other words...you can assist me if you want to."
"41d4518b","You can't interfere with the duel, of course. You can help
out beforehand...with research and training, I mean."
"42d4537e","This is a long story, so listen up. In the past, I've lost
to BanchoLeomon twice."
"43d454d1","In the first bout, it was an utter defeat. His power and
fighting instinct are practically at a genius level."
"44d45644","Then, after much training and studying...I lost again,
although it wasn't as much of a one-sided defeat."
"45d45837","From that experience...I understood that I need to follow
patterns better if I want to handle his fighting style."
"46d459aa","First...that punch...I want to temper my fighting style to
take on his punch."
"47d45b1d","Does your partner have any punching attack? If so, I can
use a sparring partner..."
"38d443a0","Hrrm... That won't do. If only you had a Digimon with a
punch attack..."
"39d44513","Sure, we'll take you out!
Sorry, now's not a good time..."
"b2dbbf53","Very well, I thank you...now let's do this!"
"b1dbbde0","Hrm... No good, huh... Urrgh...at this rate I'll never win..."
"b4dbc2b9","If only there was a Digimon around with a punch attack..."
"b3dbc0c6","Would you battle with me as a sparring partner?"
"3d82290d","Hrrrm, yes...yes, I get it now...!"
"3a8224b4","Thank you for your cooperation...I'll be able to handle
punches next time...!"
"3b822627","Next time we meet, I might have some good news for you.
...Look forward to the results of my battle!"
"754f7aa0","*sigh*"
"784f7f79","Despite all the help you gave me...I lost again..."
"774f7d86","I was able to deal with that Flashy Boss Punch. But I was
done in by another attack...one from his sharp blade..."
"7a4f825f","That's not enough to break my spirit, of course. But until I
can see a way to win, any rematch is pointless..."
"794f80ec","That's why...well, I bet you can guess."
"7c4f85a5","I need a blade-wielding Digimon to spar with me."
"7b4f8432","Hrrm, {1}, and {2}...
Doesn't look like either of them fit the bill..."
"7e4f888b","Of course we'll fight you!
Sorry, you'll need to wait a bit longer..."
"7d4f8718","Very well, again I thank you...now let's do this!"
"104c9cca","Hrm... No good, huh... Urrgh...when will I be able to..."
"114c9ebd","If only there was a blade-wielding Digimon around here..."
"e4c99e4","Would you battle with me as a sparring partner?"
"7be1c37f","Ugh..."
"7ce1c4d2","How pathetic... My fourth loss..."
"7de1c645","My guard against his punch and blade attacks was perfect...
but I still lost. Now what should I do?"
"76e1bb40","BanchoLeomon's jacket... Just looking at it leaves me
awestruck... That's my impression, anyway."
"77e1bd33","Oh... Well, in that case..."
"78e1bea6","What if I fought a Digimon with a cape...?! Might as well
give it a shot..."
"79e1c019","{1}, {2}... Hrmm...
Neither of them have a cape..."
"82e1ce64","All right, sure, we'll spar with you.
Uhh... Hold on a sec..."
"83e1cfd7","Fantastic, here's to hoping my theory is right... Heh heh...
Here I go!"
"80e409f5","No good, huh... Urgh... What can I..."
"7fe40802","If only there was a Digimon around here with a cape..."
"7ee406af","Would you battle with me as a sparring partner?"
"6187fcf2","Whew... Yes, just as I thought..."
"6087fb1f","With loss after loss, I forgot something important..."
"5f87f9ac","Believing in my own skill, no matter the opponent!"
"5e87f839","What's more..."
"5d87f646","?!"
"5c87f4d3","Yo!"
"5b87f360","Why are you here?!"
"6a880add","Say what? I got no problem with throwin' down!"
"6988096a","Well no, uh...I mean, that's fine with me...I suppose."
"dc84ecfc","I knew about this intense training of yours, y'know."
"dd84ee6f","That's why I have the most fun fighting you, Darkdramon!"
"de84efc2","Whaaaat?!"
"df84f1b5","Huh... You're right, BanchoLeomon... I feel the same way..."
"d884e6b0","The joy of combat, the splendor of a rivalry..."
"d984e823","If you understand that much...then you're already my..."
"da84e996","Hold on, save it for after the fight, yeah?"
"db84eb09","Hmph, you got that right!"
"e484f954","Watch me, would you, {0}?"
"e584fac7","Heeere IIIII gooooo!!!"
"6e8c8e57","G...Gwahh!"
"6d8c8ce4","I...won...?"
"708c91bd","Ahahahahaaa! I lost!"
"6f8c8fca","Haaahahaha! C'mon, buddy, let's go."
"6a8c882b","Hmph... Very well."
"698c86b8","{0}, would you mind if...I called you
buddy, too?"
"6c8c8b71","Darkdramon joined the city!"
"cce531ab","Hooo-wee, it's nice and cool here! I feel like a new 'mon!"
"cde5331e","I'm MarineAngemon! I come from far out east. From the ocean."
"cee534f1","The desert heat was just toooo much!"
"cfe53664","Some Digimon are bad with the heat, some bad with the cold.
You should be careful yourself!"
"d0e537d7","Guess it's about time for me to head back. See you next
time, yeah?"
"2241e914","Woohooo, lookit this water! Come take a load off! Forget all
your troubles!"
"2541eded","A brief respite in the concrete jungle... How refreshing!"
"fef05830","Ooo, well hey there! Long time no see!"
"1f05c89","Hey hey, can I, can I ask you a favor, ol' buddy ol' pal?"
"f05b16","I lost something precious to me in one of the ships on this
cape."
"3f05fef","Go and find it for me, pretty please?"
"2f05e7c","Whuzzat? What'd I lose? You'll know as soon as you see it!"
"5f06335","Let's just say it's perfect for those hard-to-reach places!"
"4f06142","All righty then, good luck and thanks in advance!"
"1c5e47dd","There's something here... This could be the item that
MarineAngemon lost."
"195e4304","Pick it up.
Don't pick it up."
"1a5e44f7","You got a Pretty Stone!"
"175e403e","You got an Old Telescope!"
"185e4191","You got a Heart Ring!"
"155e3cd8","You got a Bent Spoon!"
"327fc2c2","Oh hooo, could it be? Did you find the thing I dropped?"
"317fc16f","You handed over the Pretty Stone."
"307fbffc","Oooo, what a pretty lil' rock!"
"2f7fbe09","But this isn't the thing I dropped, y'knoooow."
"2e7fbc96","Sorry, but wouldja keep on looking for me?"
"2d7fbb23","You handed over the Old Telescope."
"2c7fb9b0","Oooo, what an awesome antique!"
"3b7fd12d","But still, this isn't the thing I dropped, y'knoooow."
"3a7fcfba","You handed over the Heart Ring."
"2d7d7c4c","Oooo, I just looove hearts!"
"2e7d7e3f","I love 'em, but I sure didn't drop one, y'knoooow."
"2f7d7f92","You handed over the Bent Spoon."
"307d8105","Yes, YES, this is the one!!!"
"297d7600","I was lost without this baby!"
"2a7d77f3","Oh... You should see the look on your face...it's like, ""How
can you eat with a bent spoon?"""
"2b7d7966","You got it wrong, buddy! Here, take a look!"
"2c7d7ad9","MarineAngemon scratched its back with the Bent Spoon!"
"357d8924","See, this is perrrrfect for those hard-to-reach spots!"
"367d8a97","Right, now I gotta do something to show my appreciation..."
"bf851e27","But hey, all I have on me is this spoon, and...naw, I'm not
gonna part with it..."
"be851cb4","All right, all riiiiight, I get it... I'll head to the city,
that'll work for you, won't it?"
"c185210d","I'm sad to part with this ocean, but...it's no substitute
for my spoon here!"
"c0851f9a","MarineAngemon joined the city!"
"b6fba5f3","..."
"b5fba400","Huh...? You...did you want something from me?"
"b8fba8d9","Whoops, sorry but I have to go. Next time, though!"
"6c93c0fb","Hyeh hyeh hyeh! This street belongs to Big Boss Justimon!"
"6d93c26e","Huh... Justimon...?"
"6e93c3c1","What, you got something to say, punk? I'll send ya to the
scrapyard!"
"6f93c5b4","Yikes!"
"7093c727","Now hold it right there!
I don't give in to bullies!"
"7193c89a","What'd you say? You lookin' to get scrapped too, punk?"
"7293ca0d","Grrr... I'll show you what happens to anyone that crosses
Big Boss Justimon!"
"c407190e","Eeek! I can't take it anymore..."
"c307179b","I'll never forgive youuuuuu!"
"c2071628","Justimon ran off at full speed..."
"c907212d","THANK YOU."
"c8071fba","THAT JUSTIMON...WAS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT HIM JUST NOW?"
"c7071dc7","NOT JUST HOW HE SPOKE...I'VE NEVER SEEN JUSTIMON LOOK SO
WEAK..."
"c6071c54","AT ANY RATE, BACK TO WORK FOR ME."
"f1b4b791","Ah yes, I remember you..."
"eeb4b2d8","I believe your name was...{0}, yes?
What was that DigiMail about?"
"efb4b44b","DigiMail? What DigiMail?
Aren't you the one that sent a DigiMail?
You seem different from before..."
"f4b4bc6a","I thought something was strange, and came to check it out,
but...heh...I think I've figured it out."
"f5b4bddd","Ah! There it is!"
"f2b4b904","Whuuuuuh?!"
"f3b4baf7","Erm...uh...eh heh heh..."
"e8b4a946","Hyogamon...so you were behind it the whole time..."
"e9b4ab39","You sent a fake DigiMail...in order to get me and
{0} to fight each other..."
"f6b6fe27","Then you disguised yourself as me, and committed evil deeds
as a fake Justimon! Isn't that right?!"
"f5b6fcb4","I have no idea what you're talking about... I've been
framed, I tells ya!"
"f8b7010d","You fought the fake me before, didn't you,
{0}? Did you sense anything odd at the time?"
"d5b826a2","Oh, I think you were using ice-based attacks!
Your head was a bit off-kilter...
You messed up your own name..."
"f2b6f7fb","There it is, unshakeable proof! Accept your punishment for
bullying the children!"
"f1b6f608","Curses... All right, the jig is up...but today, I have a
special attack that'll knock your stupid socks off--"
"f4b6fac1","BLAAAAAAAAARGHHHH!!!"
"f3b6f96e","Hmph, evil never prospers...case closed!"
"eeb6f14f","Sorry for all of this, {0}. To think, that
someone would use my name like that..."
"edb6efdc","Hmm...oh, I know! I just had a good idea."
"64af5c4c","I should stick around your city. That way, I'll be able to
do something if anymore fakes try to make waves there."
"65af5e3f","Better get while the getting's good. Looking forward to
working with you!"
"66af5f92","Justimon joined the city!"
"849a0f0a","..."
"849a0f0b","It doesn't say anything..."
"859a10fd","..."
"829a0c24","...Human...what...do you want?"
"839a0d97","You talked about Youkomon."
"809a08de","...Is this Youkomon...strong?"
"819a0ab1","You bet!
Not particularly...
Can't really say."
"7e9a05f8","...I see."
"7f9a076b","...My screw fell somewhere near the lake... Please tell
Youkomon."
"7c9a0292","I don't want any pointless conflict. I hope you see where
I'm coming from..."
"8dee7e1e","..."
"8cee7cab","I see... This Youkomon is quite persistent, from the sound
of things."
"8bee7b38","But...this place has grown on me... I don't feel like going
off somewhere else."
"92ee863d","I can't just let it go, either... The idea of it constantly
looking for me is too pitiful..."
"91ee844a","I can't ask Myotismon in the city to fight in my place
either, now can I..."
"90ee82d7","Hmm...still, I don't know...if I can get Youkomon to give
up..."
"8fee8164","Either way...Myotismon is pretty smart. He might have an
idea about what to do..."
"86ee7319","Please...go and ask Myotismon for me."
"1fe52dcb","What's this? Boltmon wants something from me?"
"20e52fbe","You conveyed Boltmon's request."
"21e53111","*sigh* Some things never change... What a troublesome
personality that 'mon has..."
"22e53284","That pacifist spirit in such a strong body... You found it
odd too, didn't you?"
"23e53477","Don't get me wrong, Boltmon's super strong WHEN he fights.
Wouldn't you want that strength here in Floatia?"
"24e535ea","How about we try a little scheme...for my friend's sake, of
course. Hmm... I got it!"
"25e5375d","You head back to Boltmon. I'll stay here and set everything
up..."
"da0cfc34","Oh, it's you, human... I got a message from Myotismon."
"dd0d008d","That's great...it sounds like they've got a plan. I should
hear from them any second now..."
"dc0cff1a","Mmm...huh?!"
"d70cf77b","Ohh, there you are! I hope you're ready, Myotismon!"
"d60cf588","Huh? Myoti...? No, you've got the wrong..."
"d90cfa41","Take this! Jaenryuuuu!"
"d80cf8ee","Stop!"
"d30cf0cf","?!"
"d20cef5c","Ugh... Oh no... I tried to dodge it, but..."
"d50ab5be","Am I...still alive...?"
"d60ab711","Whew, that was a close one!"
"d30ab258","Myotismon!"
"d40ab3cb","What's this...? Boltmon, did you beat Youkomon for me?"
"d90abbea","I called Youkomon with the intent of dueling, you know.
Hehehe..."
"da0abd5d","...Really?"
"d70ab884","Well, no skin off my nose. Looks like everything turned out
all right, wouldn't you say?"
"d80aba77","Look... Youkomon's just fainted, that's all. Let's leave the
rest to {0}, shall we?"
"cd0aa8c6","Huh...? But..."
"ce0aaab9","Don't you get it? You should come to Floatia."
"4f07a435","WereGarurumon...!"
"4e07a242","It's been lonely in the city without you, buddy!"
"4d07a0ef","Don't worry, you'll get along with everyone there. It's a
great place to live!"
"4c079f7c","I understand... They call you {0}, right? See
you there..."
"4b079d89","Boltmon joined the city!"
"4a079c16","...
..."
"49079aa3","...Unnngh...huh?"
"48079930","What? What happened to me... I don't remember anything..."
"5707b0ad","Boltmon said that he lost to you.
Um, I guess it was a tie?"
"5607af3a","Boltmon...? Oh, now I remember... So that was Boltmon, huh?"
"49055bcc","A tie...hmmm...but I was unconscious..."
"4a055dbf","I get it. It was my loss..."
"4b055f12","Lemme guess... You didn't tell me about Boltmon because you
thought I couldn't win, right?"
"4c056085","Heh...talk about a reality check. But one day I'll win,
you'll see! Us monsters are immortal!"
"951d218a","Ho ho ho... You're late, {0}..."
"941d2017","I've been watching you ever since you set foot in Bony
Resort..."
"931d1ea4","I've been keeping a close...CLOSE eye on you...ho ho, bet
you didn't notice, did you?"
"921d1d31","Well, you wouldn't know unless you're told. That's the power
of my tricks..."
"911d1b5e","But of course, it's no fun if you don't find me! For me, OR
for you."
"901d19eb","So what should we do...?"
"8f1d1878","How about a little hide-and-seek, and you're it, Tamer?
Ho ho ho ho, such diversions are what a resort's all about!"
"8e1d1685","The rules are simple. Find me in my hiding spots three times
today."
"8d1d1512","I won't leave Bony Resort. And of course, I have a reward
ready for you if you win!"
"901adb74","Now if you lose, well...that'll just be an ego boost for me.
Your partner Digimon might get a bit depressed, though..."
"911adce7","All riiiight, let's do it!
No thanks."
"921ade5a","...Oh my, is it that time already? It wouldn't be fair to
make you play with so little time left today."
"931adfcd","Make sure you come before 4 PM, okay? The earlier you get
here, the easier it'll be for you."
"8c1ad4c8","Ho ho ho, that's the spirit. Well then...let's get started!"
"4f53e329","You sense Piedmon's presence nearby..."
"4c53de50","You sense Piedmon's presence very close by..."
"4d53dfc3","!!!"
"5253e7e2","Ho ho, well done."
"5353e955","But this is just the beginning. It'll only get harder now."
"5053e49c","Piedmon went and hid in the next spot."
"5153e60f","Hmm, excellent... Very impressive that you found me here."
"5653ee2e","But you still have one round left. You'll regret it if you
start resting on your laurels now!"
"5753ef81","It can't be... I dare say I can't believe it..."
"545629bf","Ho ho, I honestly didn't think you'd make it this far. If it
was just a guess, then it was a very lucky one!"
"535627cc","I wanted to have a bit more fun, but...oh well. A promise is
a promise."
"56562c85","As a reward, I'll head over to Floatia. Of course I know
what you're after... I've been watching, after all..."
"55562b12","Ho ho, until next time...!"
"50562373","Piedmon joined the city!"
"4f562180","The sense that Piedmon is nearby has disappeared."
"ef400914","By the way, {0}. I wonder what's become of
my castle?"
"ef400915","I feel like going back and taking a look... I hope someone
is taking proper care of it."
"f0400a87","Oh my, fancy meeting you here!"
"f1400c7a","I just had to come and see. Worry not, one look around and
I'll be back in the city lickety-split."
"f2400ded","Ugh, what? What's the strange smell?"
"eb4002e8","Maaan, what a hassle. Hey, you. Go take out the trash."
"ec40045b","Huuuh? What's the problem? Just dump it over there, why
don'tcha?"
"ed4005ce","I can't believe it..."
"ee4007a1","*cough* Is that...dust?"
"e73ffcbc","*snxxxxx* *snore*"
"e83ffe2f","Mlem mlem...gimme something to drink..."
"75431a9d","For heaven's sake..."
"7443192a","Huh...what're those ghastly voices I hear?"
"734317b7","Waaahaha, let's do it to it! Haaachachachaaa!"
"724315c4","Uh huh! Who's bad...you bad? I'm bad! Woo!"
"71431451","How vulgar..."
"704312fe","What's with this place... Isn't there anyone in charge?!"
"6f43110b","Watch, I can eat ten of these in three seconds flat!"
"6e430f98","Why you...well I can do twelve! NYOM NOM NOM...*burp*"
"6d430e25","Enough enough enooooough!"
"6c430cb2","What's happening...? It's chaos in here..."
"5b453066","My room... Please tell me no one touched my room!"
"5c4531d9","Heave-ho! Heave-ho!"
"59452d00","One, two! One, two!"
"5a452ef3","Hup! Two! Three! Four!"
"5f453692","Who in the world are you?!"
"60453805","We are--"
"5d45334c","the one-and-only--"
"5e45353f","Nanimon Trio!"
"63453cde","You must be punished!"
"b86b832c","Unforgivable...my beautiful castle...my palace...my ROOM...
I won't let these vulgar creatures have their way with it!"
"bb6b87e5","Remember my anger after I carve it into your bodies!"
"ba6b8672","The only way to calm them is to make them pass out, I guess?
Uh oh, this looks bad...let's get out of here!"
"3956d0f9","*gasp!* What...what was I doing?"
"3656cc20","{0}. I see... My rage awakened my Burst Mode..."
"3756cd93","Oh, poor Tamer..."
"3c56d5b2","I'm sooo sorry I put you through that!"
"3d56d725","I can't believe you all...you thought I wouldn't return,
didn't you? How awful... How embarrassing!"
"3a56d26c","From now on, you'd better be ready for me to return without
any warning whatsoever. Understood?"
"3b56d3df","Eeeeek!"
"4056dbfe","We'll be ready, we promise!"
"4156dd51","Very good..."
"3e59170f","Oh?"
"3d59159c","Ah, you've returned."
"40591a55","My, but I suppose I cleared my head with all that.
I enjoyed fighting with you too, {0}."
"3f5918e2","From now on, I'll come back here every Sunday to discipline
my former flunkies if they're slacking off."
"3a5910c3","If you come to this room on that day, how about we have a
little bout? Just let off some steam!"
"39590f50","Now then, that's all for today! Bye byyyye!"
"5479d936","Ho ho ho ho...so you'd like to fight me, would you?"
"5379d743","Sounds good to me. After all, you're the only one that can
really go toe-to-toe with me! Now let's have some fun!"
"620b8103","Hmmm, I suppose that's that."
"630b82f6","I guess you wouldn't just let me win, now would you? But
next time won't be so easy, I promise!"
"640b8469","Well then, time to head on back."
"59fecd71","Oh, it's you, {0}..."
"56fec8b8","I didn't expect to meet you here, of all places."
"57feca2b","Me? Chaosmon asked for me."
"5cfed1ca","Me and Chaosmon go way back. He might be willing to
cooperate with us for the sake of this world."
"5dfed3bd","Yes, I'm sure of it. Come on, {0},
let's go and persuade him."
"ffc8a332","Ugh, wait, {0}!"
"fec8a15f","Look, someone's erected a weak electromagnetic barrier..."
"fdc89fec","But we've gotta get through here... Maybe if we just break
on through it...?"
"fcc89e79","I'll go first. You follow after me."
"46617abf","Huh? I still cant..."
"47617c12","No, there's something below!"
"48617d85","I see...while the thin barrier catches your attention,
another trap on the ground gets you..."
"41617280","What an elaborate trick... Did someone know I was gonna come
through here...?"
"42617473","It can't be..."
"3fcf31e0","Huh? That's..."
"42cf36b9","Chaosmon!"
"41cf34c6","Urgh...stay away, ShineGreymon!"
"44cf399f","That's...do you see that, {0}? Those darkness
particles are the same as when I was captured..."
"43cf382c","At this rate...Chaosmon's life is in danger!"
"46cf3ce5","Who in the world did this...?"
"45cf3b72","It's no good, I'm stuck in this trap...but I can't just sit
back and do nothing!"
"801e04d","Kuooooooooooh!"
"501dbf4","HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!"
"601dd67","What...?!"
"301d8ae","P-Power... Power is coursing through my body!"
"401da01","...!"
"101d548","Okay..."
"201d73b","You got free?!"
"ff01d262","This is the legendary power..."
"1d3d5","I never thought I'd be lucky enough to gain it here and now."
"ed03f4a3","..."
"ec03f330","Yes, how lucky for you."
"ef03f789","What the--?!"
"ee03f616","Ho...ho ho......muhahahahaha!!!"
"f103faef","Chaos...mon...?"
"f003f97c","Magnificent... The creation energy you possess is truly
amazing, ShineGreymon."
"f303fe35","What...?"
"f203fc42","Wow, you can still talk?"
"f504011b","The traps...no...don't tell me, you were behind them all..."
"f403ffa8","That's right..."
"7afc8568","In order to be the strongest there is...I need energy to
maintain this unstable form."
"7bfc86db","An extraordinary amount of energy...just like the energy
created in Burst Mode."
"7cfc884e","With this...I can leave these dark depths... I could even
take this world for my own...ho ho ho...ha ha ha..."
"7dfc8a21","{0}...! Please...you must..."
"7efc8b94","Ah yes, this one was outside of my calculations...
{0}, was it? Yes, you, human..."
"7ffc8d07","I didn't expect you all to come along with ShineGreymon."
"80fc8efa","But this is a simple miscalculation, nothing more... With
this power, it'll take but a moment to eliminate you all."
"81fc906d","You should consider yourselves lucky, in a way...for you get
a chance to behold my full power!"
"10564dee","You...did it!"
"f564c7b","How..."
"e564a88","How did you--! I can't believe it! I...I don't understand!"
"1556558d","Ah... My power...my ultimate... Ngaaaaaaaah!"
"1456541a","The power of humans...of Tamers...is beyond calculation..."
"135652a7","What did you say? That...that was just a miscalculation!"
"12565134","Hmph. I guess even an amazing Digimon like you can miss the
point. Yes, human power alone couldn't possibly beat you."
"95642e9","But when combined with that of partner Digimon...that power
increases exponentially... That's where you miscalculated."
"8564176","Heh...now I get it..."
"b540758","It was...my utter defeat. And the loser...must perish..."
"c5408cb","Chaosmon... I won't...let...!"
"d540abe","ShineGreymon... What're you...?!"
"e540c11","You said it yourself... My energy can..."
"f540d84","I see... I'm already restored. Hmph..."
"10540f77","{0}. You've completely thwarted my ambitions.
No need to hold back... Go on, laugh at me."
"115410ea","Ah, well you see... {0} here has overcome all
kinds of hardships, so..."
"1254125d","Hmph, so I can't even get a laugh outta you?"
"353fae0","Something like that."
"453fc53","Fine, fine. I'll just have to let it go... So listen,
{0}, make me one of your allies."
"7d5b7693","If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, right? If I join you, I'm
sure to get stronger than I am now."
"7c5b7520","Not a bad idea, if you ask me."
"7f5b79f9","Right? Heh heh, all right then!"
"7e5b7806","Chaosmon joined the city!"
"11fa8a77","Once you pass through these caves, you'll be at MOD Cape."
"12fa8bea","The MOD Ship is a pirate vessel. The crew's long gone, from
the sound of it, but there are still strong Digimon around."
"13fa8d5d","You won't see me setting foot in there, that's for sure! And
oh yeah...this is a bit out of the blue, but..."
"cfa8258","Are you interested in flowers? Each flower that blooms in
this world symbolizes something different."
"dfa83cb","I'm a bit of a romantic Digimon, so I looove the symbology
of flowers...and if you want, I can teach you a few things."
"efa85be","Today's lesson is..."
"15fccf1a","The tough rose, symbolizing hardiness. While beautiful, this
flower also boasts a steel-like sturdiness."
"14fccda7","Partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> and STA increased!"
"13fccc34","The fox lily, symbolizing innocence. This flower is
delicate, and is quite difficult to make blossom."
"12fcca41","Partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> increased, and <icon>疲労</icon> decreased a little!"
"11fcc8ee","The hat tulip, symbolizing intelligence. This fashionable
flower looks like a multicolored hat."
"10fcc77b","Partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> and WIS increased!"
"ffcc588","The abrupt cherry blossom, symbolizing swiftness. Quick to
bloom and quick to fall, this flower is a hasty one."
"efcc415","Partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> and SPD increased!"
"dfcc2a2","The muscle cosmos, symbolizing herculean strength. This
powerful bud will bloom vigorously just about anywhere."
"fcfee656","Partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> and STR increased!"
"fdfee7c9","The shifty calabash, symbolizing change. This interesting
flower changes shape as the day goes on."
"fafee370","All partner skills increased!"
"fbfee4e3","The sky hibiscus, symbolizing exhilaration. An invigorating
flower invoking both the sky and the sea."
"feec82","Partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> greatly increased!"
"1feee75","The spinny sunflower symbolizes eternity.
It's a strange flower. The head spins like a pinwheel."
"fefee9bc","Partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> increased!
Life also increased a little!"
"fffeeb2f","The veranda lavender symbolizes tranquility.
It's well loved for its relaxing fragrance and hardiness."
"4fef2ce","Partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> and HP increased!"
"5fef4a1","The freeze freesia symbolizes perseverance.
It only grows in extremely cold places."
"8301f7df","Partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> and MP increased!"
"78f09f20","Come back tomorrow if you're still interested in flowers."
"41e69c3a","Electricity... Give me electricity!"
"40e69a47","Urgh...
I got a little overexcited."
"3fe698d4","I'm Fugamon. Forget meat and veggies. I prefer electricity."
"3ee69761","That's why I've come to this power plant.
But it's so secure, I can't get any of the electricity."
"3de6958e","I'll just have to look for another power plant.
Bye."
"7db3f399","Haha, you again!"
"7ab3eec0","The surging electricity gives me such a rush!
But it's still not enough."
"7bb3f0b3","I want more electricity!"
"80b3f852","You don't have any Conductor Lemons I could have, do you?"
"81b3f9c5","I've heard Conductor Lemons will give me more of a buzz."
"7eb3f50c","Can you bring me five Conductor Lemons?
I'll make it worth your while."
"7fb3f6ff","Are those Conductor Lemons I see?
Have you got five of them?"
"84b3fe9e","Here you go.
I've changed my mind."
"85b40071","Haha! Thanks!
Here's your reward."
"82b63a2f","You got Stamina Chip Mini x 2!"
"81b638bc","You haven't got enough space in your inventory.
Make some room so I can give you your reward."
"84b63d75","I still need more Conductor Lemons.
The reward isn't much, but I'm counting on you."
"83b63b82","Haha! What a day! Positively electrifying!"
"7eb633e3","Oh, do you have Conductor Lemons for me?
I'll pay 1,500 <icon>BIT</icon> for five of them."
"7db63270","You got 1500 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"e323a2c9","Yeah, this will do nicely. Haha.
Huh?"
"e0239e70","Oh?! Where did you come from?
I wasn't doing anything. I am...MegaSeadramon."
"e1239fe3","I heard there's a new lake here, so I came to see it."
"e623a782","The water is absolutely amazing.
I think I'll stay here for now."
"e723a975","Huh? Live in Floatia?
No, the water here's much nicer."
"e423a4bc","Hmm... One day, sooner or later."
"e523a62f","Huh? You know of another MegaSeadramon?
You must be thinking of an acquaintance of mine."
"ea23adce","You find it confusing? I can see why.
Well, just call me MegaSeadramon (Lake)."
"a8edab2a","Oh, what do you want?
What, I wasn't doing anything."
"a7eda9b7","I was having fun. Don't just come and start talking to me."
"265a9f17","Oh?
I've been littering?"
"275aa08a","What are you talking about?
I don't remember anything like that."
"285aa27d","Oh, that trash?
I don't know. It must have washed up from the lake."
"c337fef8","I stole a Koromon's food?
Hey, I'd never do something like that."
"c63803b1","It must have been someone else who looks like me."
"c53801de","Yeah, that's it. Someone who looks like me."
"c8380697","Hey!
What are you doing here?!"
"c7380524","Something pretty bad must have happened to
bring me here all the way from Floatia, right?"
"ca3809fd","It certainly is a pleasant town, but I've come to defend my
honor."
"c938080a","You're not fooling anyone. Show your true form!"
"bc37f3f3","Damn, I thought I'd gotten away with it!"
"bb37f200","The WaruSeadramon disguised as MegaSeadramon (Lake) has
revealed its true form!"
"be35b862","Now I've regained my strength!
I'm even stronger than MegaSeadramon!"
"bf35b9d5","It's just bluffing.
{0}, don't believe it. Teach it a lesson."
"6d01dae5","Huh?!
How are you so strong?!"
"6a01d62c","Urgh, no! You'll pay for this!"
"6b01d79f","Running away as usual. Even I'm not that bad.
Really too much."
"6801d2c6","Well done, {0}.
I'd like to reward you for defending my honor."
"6901d4b9","Can you come see me later?
Bye for now."
"c233c087","Oh, it's you again? Huh?"
"c333c27a","I'll keep coming back until I make you pay."
"c433c3ed","The same thing will happen every time! Hahaha!"
"ca29e24c","WHAT ARE YOU?!
OH, A HUMAN."
"cd29e705","DO YOU KNOW GRANKUWAGAMON? I HEARD IT LIVES HERE."
"cc29e592","I'VE BEEN DIGGING HOLES LIKE CRAZY, BUT JUST CAN'T FIND IT."
"c729ddf3","THE ENTIRE AREA'S COVERED IN THE HOLES I DUG."
"c629dc00","BE CAREFUL NOT TO FALL INTO ANY."
"447adaa7","It's a pitfall!"
"457adc1a","You followed an adjoining hole back to the entrance."
"467add8d","You found something in the hole."
"3f7ad288","You got Magiforcepine!"
"407ad47b","But your inventory is full and you left it behind."
"9ab0feba","WHAT HAPPENED? DID YOU FALL DOWN A HOLE?"
"99b0fcc7","HUH?! YOU FOUND A GRANKUWAGAMON ITEM
IN THE HOLE OVER THERE?!"
"98b0fb54","THAT'S A MAJOR CLUE! GOOD WORK."
"97b0f9e1","HUH? YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I'M SEARCHING 
FOR GRANKUWAGAMON?"
"96b0f80e","GRANKUWAGAMON IS THE LEGENDARY HERO
OF THE INSECTOID DIGIMON WORLD!"
"95b0f69b","HERCULESKABUTERIMON IS ALSO PRETTY AMAZING, BUT I'M A
DEVOTED GRANKUWAGAMON FAN."
"94b0f528","I JUST REALLY WANT TO MEET MY HERO, THAT'S ALL."
"93b0f3b5","HE HAS TO BE IN THIS DESERT! RIGHT, BACK TO WORK!"
"92b0f1c2","OH, SORRY. I'LL FILL IN THIS HOLE. THANKS FOR THE
INFORMATION."
"3d95e1b5","HI, WHAT'S UP?
I'M NOT DIGGING ANY HOLES FOR NOW. I'M TAKING A BREAK."
"3a95dcfc","WHAT?! YOU MET GRANKUWAGAMON?! TELL ME WHERE!"
"3b95de6f","AND YOU BEAT HIM?! YOU MUST TAKE ME FOR A FOOL!"
"3895d996","YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDDING. JUST ADMIT IT."
"3995db09","THE HUMAN IS SPEAKING THE TRUTH."
"3695d6b0","HUH? WHAT?!"
"3795d823","IT SEEMS YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ME."
"4495ecba","I LIVE IN FLOATIA NOW. THERE'S NO POINT SEARCHING FOR ME.
I'VE JUST COME TO LET TELL YOU SOMETHING."
"4595ee2d","BLUE MEGAKABUTERIMON, IN ALL YOUR ENDEAVORS, NEVER FORGET
THE PRIDE OF THE INSECTOID DIGIMON."
"c298f14b","..."
"c198efd8","GRANKUWAGAMON..."
"c498f491","HUMAN, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING."
"c398f33e","You got Caerulicornice!"
"c698f7f7","Your inventory is full. You can't collect any more items."
"c598f604","HUMAN, THE GRANKUWAGAMON'S WORDS WILL STAY WITH ME FOREVER."
"243ac353","Oh, I've been waiting for you, human."
"253ac4c6","I heard you're really clever. Can you solve a puzzle for me?"
"263ac6b9","I'll give you something nice if you get it right.
Let me explain."
"273ac82c","There are Meteormon No. 1 to No. 5 here."
"283ac99f","But one of them is actually a Gotsumon. And only one of them
is lying."
"293acb72","I want you to figure out who is the Gotsumon and who is the
liar."
"2a3acce5","So can you talk to all five of them and then tell me the
answer?"
"5089e138","Please talk to No. 0 first."
"5389e5f1","I'm not a Gotsumon."
"5289e41e","Congratulations. Well done."
"5589e8d7","Oh no, did you get it wrong?"
"fa53bd25","Talk to No. 0 first, okay?"
"f753b86c","The one facing east isn't a Gotsumon, okay?"
"f853b9df","Hahaha, I'm a Gotsumon, okay?"
"f553b506","Did you fail? Never mind, okay?"
"627e9e6a","Speak to No. 0 first."
"617e9cf7","The one opposite me isn't a Gotsumon."
"607e9b04","I was right, wasn't I?"
"5f7e9991","Huh, did you get it wrong?"
"dfeb9257","You should speak to No. 0 first."
"e0eb93ca","The one next to me is lying."
"e1eb95bd","Hehehe, there's no fooling you."
"daeb8ab8","Did you listen to me properly?"
"1d067d3c","Go and talk to No. 0 first."
"200681f5","The Gotsumon ends every sentence with ""okay?"""
"1f068002","Well done. Did you have fun?"
"1a067863","Too bad. Have another try."
"9cb49609","Now that you've spoken to them, do you have an answer?"
"99b491b0","I'm ready to answer.
I'm not ready to answer yet."
"9ab49323","Which one is the liar?"
"9fb49ac2","No. 1 is the liar.
No. 2 is the liar.
Another one is the liar."
"a0b49cb5","No. 3 is the liar.
No. 4 is the liar.
No. 5 is the liar."
"9db497fc","I see. So which one is the Gotsumon?"
"9eb4996f","No. 1 is the Gotsumon.
No. 2 is the Gotsumon.
Another one is the Gotsumon."
"a3b4a10e","No. 3 is the Gotsumon.
No. 4 is the Gotsumon.
No. 5 is the Gotsumon."
"a4b4a2e1","Okay, let me check."
"21b7a61f","The liar is No. 4 and the Gotsumon is No. 2!
Correct! Well done!"
"20b7a4ac","Here's your reward."
"23b7a965","You got a Lapsapraecepice!"
"22b7a7f2","Your inventory is full! Come back another time."
"1db79fd3","Uh-oh! Too bad."
"1cb79e60","You can't try again today! Come back tomorrow."
"1fb7a339","Excellent work, detective!"
"17fd9e96","Oh!
It's you, the human Tamer everyone's been talking about."
"16fd9d23","I'm GoldVeedramon."
"15fd9bb0","I'm RedVeedramon.
Well, let's... Huh? What's wrong?"
"1cfda6b5","Hmm...
It looks like the human doesn't know who we are."
"1bfda4c2","We're quite well-known when it comes to combinations."
"1afda36f","You could say we're experts in joint tactics.
People come from far and wide for our lectures."
"19fda1fc","You and your partners look like quite a team.
How would you like to take our test?"
"20fdace1","Hehe, I don't need to wait for your answer.
Your partners look very keen."
"1ffdab0e","I'd expect nothing less. Well then, let's start with the
basics."
"12fb5800","Raise DigiFriend to 70+, and raise one's Strength to 500+
and the other's Stamina to 500+."
"13fb59f3","Meet these conditions."
"14fb5b66","It divides up attack and defense work.
It's a good strategy to use against strong opponents."
"15fb5cd9","Come back when you've done it. We'll be waiting!"
"16fb5e4c","Wow, have you met our conditions already? Well done."
"17fb603f","Here... Take these."
"18fb6192","You're back? Well, let's see how your partners are
shaping up."
"19fb6305","Hmm, you've met our conditions."
"1afb64f8","You haven't met our conditions yet.
Let me explain them again."
"1bfb666b","You got a Strength Chip and a Stamina Chip!"
"a502f9fb","You're only just getting started. Time for the next target."
"a402f808","Raise DigiFriend to 80+, and raise both of their Speed and
Wisdom to 600+."

It's very powerful against large numbers of enemies."
"a602fb6e","You got a Speed Chip and a Wisdom Chip!"
"a9030027","You haven't finished yet. Time for the next target."
"a802feb4","Raise DigiFriend to 90+, and raise one's HP to 7,000+ and
the other's MP to 7,000+."

combination."
"9e00b01f","Come back if you're interested.
We're always happy to talk about combination preparedness."
"9b00ab46","Hmm... You haven't got any space in your inventory.
I'll look after your reward until you can collect it."

"ca78542f","You asked about combination preparedness!"
"c7784f56","Your partners' DigiFriend increased a little!"
"c87850c9","Your partners' DigiFriend is maxed out!"
"c5784c70","We've covered enough for now. Come back tomorrow."
"e24640c5","HEY, YOU!"

"8a235c81","What? You want to pass?
Hmm, what can I do?"
"89235b2e","You need to prove you're not with the Veggie Troops."
"8c235fe7","Huh?! Oh no!"
"8b235e74","Come on!
Smash the Meaty Troops' fort!"
"8e2362cd","This isn't good. If we lose our fort, the Meaty Troops are
done for!"
"8d23615a","Oh! We've never seen you before! You're in for a world of
hurt!"
"80234cc3","Huh? This is crazy!"

"9f0a6d2f","No, not again! Retreat, retreat!"
"9e0a6bbc","You're amazing. Thank you so much."
"bd2e8499","Oh, hello. What is it?"
"ba2e7fc0","The Meaty-Veggie War is over, but a new enemy may surface.
I'll stay here and stand guard."
"b0da10cc","Sorry, can't let you pass. There have been reports
of someone suspicious lurking around!"
"950e193f","Hehehe, I've finally tracked it down."
"960e1a92","We found out they have a hidden field. I never expected it
to be here."
"970e1c05","Hehe, but what to do now?! I have to make sure they can
never use it again."
"900e1100","Huh? What? Have I been discovered?"
"910e12f3","Wait! Get back! Or else...I'll set fire to the meat in the
field!"
"920e1466","Huh? Hey! Hey! I'll do it."
"930e15d9","The RedVegiemon set fire to the meat."
"9c0e2424","Huh? It's not really burning. What is that?"
"9d0e2597","It smells amazing!"
"9a105fb5","I...I can't contain myself!"
"99105dc2","Munch munch munch!"
"98105c6f","Oh, it tastes so good!"
"97105afc","I never imagined meat could be so delicious!
How could this be?"
"96105909","But now I'm thinking it might go really well with roasted
vegetables!"
"95105796","That's it! I've made up my mind!
I'm gonna quit the Veggie Troops!"
"94105623","But I'm not joining the Meaty Troops!
I'll stay here and be neutral!"
"931054b0","That means I no longer have any reason to fight you."
"a2106c2d","I've just had an idea.
Come back here in a little while, okay?"
"13ee3fb0","Hehehe, I've finally tracked it down."
"16ee4409","We found out the Meaty Troops have a hidden field.
I never expected it to be here."
"2bec2681","That's it! I've made up my mind! I'm gonna live here!"
"28ec21c8","Back when I was in the Veggie Troops, I would have sabotaged
this field. But not anymore!"
"29ec23bb","So do you think you could leave me be?
Hmm... Actually..."
"26ec1ee2","I've just had an idea.
Come back here in a little while, okay?"
"202eb344","Oh, you're back."
"232eb81d","I'm neutral now that I've left the Veggie Troops.
I can procure vegetables but can't get hold of any meat."
"222eb6aa","If you could bring me some meat, I'll swap vegetables for it."
"1d2eae8b","You like the sound of that? Hehehe, off you go."
"1c2ead18","Okay, choose which meat you want to swap."
"1f2eb1d1","I need meat. I'll swap vegetables for it.
I can't take that."
"1e2eb07e","It's a kind of meat, but I can't take it."
"192ea85f","Great. Okay then..."
"182ea6ec","You gave Meat x 1 and got Ginseng!"
"9b2ba34e","You gave Hunks of Meat x 1 and got Sakura Bird Radish x 1!"
"9c2ba521","You gave Best Meat x 1 and got Obscure Onion x 1!"
"992ba068","You gave Well Done Meat and got Drizzle Cabbage x 1!"
"9a2ba1db","You gave Marbled Beef x 1 and got Spotted Tomato x 1!"
"9f2ba9fa","You gave Cube Meat x 1 and got Jaguar Potato x 1!"
"a02bab6d","You gave Steel Meat x 1 and got Kamon Aubergine x 1!"
"9d2ba694","You gave Colorful Meat x 1 and got Soft Gold Pumpkin x 1!"
"9e2ba807","It's no good. Looks like your inventory's full."
"932b96d6","Right, time to chow down! Munch! It's so good!"
"942b9849","Wow, I'm so full. Come back when I'm hungry again."
"aef77962","Phew! It's so hot!"
"adf7778f","Huh? Human, do you like the heat as well?"
"acf7761c","I love the heat. I am an Icemon after all!"
"abf774a9","Is there something strange about that? I'm not bound by
convention."
"aaf77336","I came here from somewhere really cold. But it's even hotter
than I expected. It's great."
"a9f77143","Look at that lava flow! It's so gloopy...huh?"
"a8f76fd0","Oh no! My body's gone all gloopy!"
"b7f7874d","No way? Am I melting? Come on, body...stay together..."
"b6f785da","I know. Have any of your partners got ice skills?"
"a9f532ec","If so, could you use one on me?"
"aaf5345f","{1} used an ice attack on Icemon!"
"abf53632","{2} used an ice attack on Icemon!"
"acf537a5","Sadly none of your partners can use ice skills."
"a5f52ca0","Oh! Looks like I've stopped melting?!"
"a6f52e13","Phew, thanks. I may love the heat, but my body doesn't."
"a7f52f86","But now I can stay here a little longer.
Here's a token of my thanks."
"a8f53179","You got HP Chip Mini x 2!"
"b1f53f44","I hope you'll come back. I'll need your help if I start
melting again."
"b2f54137","Hmm... It looks like you're carrying too many items.
Hurry up and makes some space."
"bbfc0ac7","Urgh, I'm melting. Please help...while I still have my
strength!"
"bafc0954","Are you ready now? I'll give you a reward."
"92da3a1","It's so hot! I love it here."
"62d9ee8","Oh no, I've started melting again!
Please, you know what to do!"
"72da05b","Phew, just in the nick of time. Here's your reward."
"c2da87a","You got 500 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"525aac18","Hey! Human, stay back!"
"555ab0d1","I'm about to explode. This won't end well for you!"
"545aaf7e","Huh? Those are some tough looking partners you've got there."
"575ab437","I guess you might be okay then. Only one way to find out..."
"565ab244","The BomberNanimon exploded!"
"595ab71d","{1} and {2}
protected {0} and took the damage!"
"585ab5aa","I...went off."
"4b5aa113","Sorry, that was a pretty big bang. It's scattered my body
far and wide."
"4a5a9fa0","Could you go and gather up the pieces?
I hate to ask, but really need your help."
"cd579c02","My torso, right arm, left arm, right leg, and left leg.
Bring me all five pieces."
"ce579df5","Judging by the trajectories..."
"cb57993c","They're probably in Nigh Plains, Server Desert, Ohguino
Wastelands, MOD Cape, and Faulty Ex Machina."
"344e233","You found the BomberNanimon Torso!"
"444e3a6","You found the BomberNanimon Right Arm!"
"544e519","You found the BomberNanimon Left Arm!"
"644e68c","You found the BomberNanimon Right Leg!"
"744e87f","You found the BomberNanimon Left Leg!"
"844e9d2","You put it in your inventory."
"944eb45","...but your inventory is full, so you left it behind."
"8396c8e6","Hey! I see you've got all the parts. Good job!"
"8296c773","You returned all the parts to the BomberNanimon."
"8196c580","The BomberNanimon regenerated!"
"8896d085","Hehe... Right, now I can say what I wanted to say."
"8796cf12","Huh?"
"8696cdbf","Sorry, I've completely forgotten what I wanted to ask you."
"8596cbcc","Although you've already done a lot of hard work for me.
Let's just put the past behind us!"
"8c96d731","Here's a little something to say thanks."
"8b96d55e","You got Reliquite x 5!"
"7e948250","Don't worry. Those stones don't explode. If you want an
explosion, use them for Digivolution. Haha!"
"7f9483c3","Huh? It looks like your inventory's full."
"809485b6","Have you got space? Then take your reward."
"46ce4a55","Oh, you're here, {0}."
"43ce459c","I am Doumon, practitioner of the occult."
"44ce470f","I am studying implements of the occult. I believe you can be
of help."
"41ce42b6","There is one thing I would like to humbly request of you."
"42ce4429","Could you collect the materials necessary for me to make a
new Taoistic Charm?"
"3fce3f50","I require three Corianders, three Deep Sea Essences, and
five Oily Fruit."
"40ce40c3","I know it is a lot to ask, but I will give you the Taoistic
Charm when it is finished."
"4dce555a","I would greatly appreciate your assistance."
"4ece56cd","Oh, I forgot to mention..."
"4bd090eb","Do not speak of this to Taomon. I appreciate that he is a
fellow occultist..."
"4ad08f78","...but I hear the turmoil of this world keeps him very busy.
I would hate to give him yet one more thing to worry about."
"4dd09431","Make sure you keep this between us, I implore you."
"595118f6","I will be waiting for you."
"58511703","I require three Corianders, three Deep Sea Essences, and
five Oily Fruit."
"57511590","Corianders grow in tropical areas. Check the roadsides for a
red plant."
"5e512095","Deep Sea Essences can be found deep under the ocean, but I
hear they are also sold in vending machines."
"5d511f22","Oily Fruit is relatively easy to find in most places, but
most abundant in desert areas."
"66e2c0c3","Oh, it looks like you have everything I need."
"67e2c2b6","Give them to him.
Don't give them to him."
"68e2c429","You give him three Corianders, three Deep Sea Essences, and
five Oily Fruit."
"69e2c59c","Hmm? What is the matter? Won't you let me have them?"
"6ae2c70f","I have completed the main components. Now just to combine
them..."
"6be2c8e2","Hehe, I have finished. Here you go."
"6ce2ca55","You received Doumon's Taoistic Charm."
"6de2cbc8","?!"
"6ee2cdbb","Oh, what has happened?"
"6be50759","Ah, I know."
"6ae505e6","Any human who holds this charm will be unable to move.
Hehe, what a fascinating new discovery."
"69e50473","But this is most convenient. Perhaps I try out some tests on
you."
"68e50280","!"
"6fe50d85","The charm vanished."
"6ee50c12","{0}, can you move now?"
"6de50abf","What's the matter with you? Are you stupid or just gullible?"
"6ce508cc","Huh?! Taomon, what are you doing here?"
"73e51431","I found out that you were here."
"72e5125e","I am investigating strange data waves around the world.
How could I fail to discover traces of your evil?"
"71e74f42","I thought I had eliminated all traces."
"72e75135","If not for the fact that you and I have a long history,
I very likely would not have discovered it."
"6fe74c7c","Neither I nor {0} have time to waste on you."
"70e74def","Exploiting {0}'s kindness in an attempt to do
such evil... You underestimate me."
"6de74916","As if you have not bought your fair share of humans?
Why the sudden change of heart?"
"6ee74a89","There is a much quicker way than explaining.
...{0}."
"6be74630","Punish this scoundrel.
Show no mercy."
"6ce747a3","What?!
No..."
"79e75c3a","Do not even attempt to flee or in any way disrespect my
magic circle."
"7ae75dad","Looks like I will have to put you in your place!"
"f7ea60cb","You are beaten, yet still you do not give up? You've always
been stubborn."
"bd42c2ec","Argh... I...I submit!"
"c042c7a5","Very well. That is enough for today."
"bf42c632","You are not a fool. Surely you understand that antagonizing
{0} can only end badly for you."
"ba42be13","I understand. Hmph... {0}."
"b942bca0","Take these."
"bc42c179","He put Wisdom Chips on the ground."
"bb42bf86","You got Wisdom Chip x 2!"
"c642d137","Taomon, I will stay vigilant to ensure that this human is
not deceived by any more bad Digimon."
"c542cf44","...Good luck with that."
"383fb2d6","I am sure Doumon will stay in line from now on. But you must
learn not to be so trusting."
"c31159e6","Has the human come, Kuro-rin?"
"c2115873","Looks like it, Kuro-cchi. I figured the human would be
along about now!"
"c1115680","Hey, human! This is MOD Cape!"
"c8116185","This place used to be a pirate hideout."
"c7116012","Now the only traces of them are the ships they abandoned."
"c6115ebf","You can follow the ships and the bridge to reach an area in
the north."
"c5115ccc","To be honest, we used to be pirate apprentices!
But they disbanded before we became full-fledged pirates."
"cc116831","So now our new goal is to become the strongest of all!"
"cb11665e","That's why we've been waiting...
for you!"
"be0f1350","If we can defeat your combination, we'll be famous!"
"bf0f14c3","That's right. Sorry, but you're going down!"
"c00f16b6","Huh?! We should have been able to defeat you.
Never mind. Let's make sure it wasn't just a fluke!"
"e04fc85","Ouch..."
"b04f7cc","Argh..."
"c04f9bf","What the...?!"
"904f4e6","Right, now that we've warmed up..."
"a04f659","Yeah, time for the real thing, Kuro-rin."
"704f180","I'm not gonna hold back, Kuro-cchi!"
"91d53d18","Argh..."
"94d541d1","Urgh..."
"93d5407e","(Kuro-rin...can you stand?)"
"96d54537","(Kuro-cchi...I think so.)"
"95d54344","Argh!"
"98d5481d","Urgh!"
"97d546aa","It ain't over 'til it's over!"
"8ad53213","Don't give up yet!"
"7d33d737","Argh..."
"7e33d8aa","Urgh..."
"7f33da1d","(Kuro-rin...it's impossible.)"
"7833cf18","(Kuro-cchi...I need a break.)"
"7933d08b","Well. That was interesting."
"7a33d27e","Indeed."
"7b33d3d1","Okay, let's go home."
"7433c8ec","See ya."
"2f617ce3","Huh? Is that a human I see?"
"30617e56","Have you come in search of treasure?"
"31617fc9","Unfortunately there isn't any actual treasure here anymore."
"326181bc","But there are some valuable things that might be of interest
to a pirate enthusiast..."
"3361832f","That's right. When I say pirate enthusiast, I'm talking
about this BlackGatomon right here!"
"34618482","If you find any interesting pirate-related items, it would
be great if you could bring them to me."
"35618675","I'll buy them for a fair price.
Think it over!"
"73678288","You found some pirate junk!"
"76678741","Pick it up.
Don't pick it up."
"756785ee","Your inventory is full. You couldn't pick it up."
"78678aa7","You got one Red Pirate Flag."
"77678934","You got one Red Pirate Glove."
"7a678d8d","You got one Red Pirate Bandanna."
"79678c1a","You got one Dark Pirate Flag."
"6c677783","You got one Dark Pirate Box."
"6b677610","You got one Dark Pirate Rope."
"6e653c72","You got one Blue Pirate Flag."
"6f653de5","You got one Blue Pirate Shirt."
"6c65392c","You got one Blue Pirate Bottle."
"6d653a9f","You got one Gold Pirate Mug."
"108a3af5","How did it go? Got anything for me?"
"d8a363c","Oh!
You got three colors of pirate flags!"
"e8a37af","Oh!
You got a dark pirate set!"
"b8a32d6","Oh!
You got a red pirate set!"
"c8a3449","Oh!
You got a blue pirate set!"
"98a2ff0","Oh!
You got a Gold Pirate Mug!"
"a8a3163","You deserve a special bonus."
"178a45fa","You got 2,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"188a476d","You got 5,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"958d4a8b","You got 10,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"948d4918","Which will you give me?"
"978d4dd1","Okay, it's a deal!"
"968d4c7e","You got 100 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"998d5137","You got 200 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"988d4f44","You got 300 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"9b8d541d","Bring me more! Bring me more!"
"9a8d52aa","Huh? Are you quitting?"
"9b20d11c","Oh, you're here."
"9e20d5d5","Just as I thought."
"9d20d462","This is Faulty Ex Machina."
"9820cc43","It's a valley made of mechanical moving blocks."
"9720cad0","Do you see those huge gears? Both they and this ground are
made from ancient technology."
"9a20cfa9","Up ahead is the control room that moves the ground.
I think you can change the path layout from there."
"9920ce36","I think that explains everything."
"a420df67","I think so, Kuro-cchi."
"a320ddf4","Kuro-rin, do you think the human hasn't realized who we are?"
"961e8a86","Because you've changed from black to blue?
Can't you fix that?"
"971e8c79","No, it's no use trying! I just have to accept being blue!"
"941e87a0","I was only kidding.
Shall we go home?"
"951e8913","Just in case {0} has forgotten us, let's
remind 'em who we are."
"9a1e9132","We've Digivolved.
In our effort to become the strongest of all!"
"9b1e92a5","We weren't quite strong enough last time, but you're no
match for us now."
"981e8dec","Let's give 'em a taste of our ferocious power!"
"991e8f5f","Hahaha! Back for more?
Fine, we'll fight until you learn your lesson!"
"5cc8b237","Huh... What the...?"
"5dc8b3aa","Urgh... Argh..."
"5ec8b51d","(Kuro-rin...did I screw up somehow?)"
"57c8aa18","(Kuro-cchi...I don't think so.)"
"58c8ab8b","Right, we've warmed up now!"
"59c8ad7e","Oh yeah! We'd only just Digivolved, so weren't quite ready
yet!"
"5ac8aed1","Now it's time for the real thing!
Come on, Kuro-rin!"
"53c8a3ec","I've got this! Kuro-cchi!
Argh!"
"40e264ca","No...way..."
"3fe26357","Not...again..."
"3ee261e4","(Kuro-rin...how about...we try...one more time...?)"
"3de26071","(Kuro-cchi...I could...just about...handle it...)"
"3ce25e9e","Whoa!"
"3be25d2b","Such strength!"
"3ae25bb8","Oh no, we're not done yet!"
"39e259c5","Did you think we'd finished?
We haven't, not by a long way!"
"ed99d785","(Kuro-rin...this is not good...)"
"ea99d2cc","(Kuro-cchi...yeah...it's bad...)"
"eb99d4bf","(Oh... My body... It's...)"
"e899cfe6","(Hold on... How can this be?)"
"e999d159","No way? We...we've Digivolved!"
"e699cc80","How? I mean...just as we planned!"
"e799ce73","Now there's no way we'll lose!"
"f499e28a","Yeah, this is the end!"
"f599e47d","You're no match for us now!
There's only one possible outcome!"
"716a1818","Huh?! What the...?!"
"746a1cd1","But...we Digivolved?!"
"736a1b7e","(Kuro-rin...I guess we need to take things slowly?)"
"766a2037","(Kuro-cchi...back to the drawing board.)"
"756a1e44","Erm... What happened?
Did we fall asleep?"
"786a231d","Ye...yeah. I had a strange dream.
But I've already forgotten it."
"776a21aa","Shall we go home?"
"6a6a0d13","Yeah, let's go.
What a day."
"5e590cd9","You! Stop right there!"
"5b590800","Hmm..."
"5c5909f3","My apologies.
You may pass."
"61591192","You're still a child.
I'll leave you alone until you grow up."
"62591305","Hehehe, I've got my eye on you."
"5f590e4c","My name is BlackWarGrowlmon.
I am a hunter of black weapons."
"6059103f","I only fight black Digimon, or Digimon armed with black
weapons. That's just my style."
"655917de","Once I set my sights on you, there's no escape."
"665919b1","Let's make this a clean fight!"
"228bb57a","Urgh...
I'm actually glad."
"218bb387","I never expected such strength from a human's partner."
"208bb214","I admit that you're stronger than me, at least for now."
"1f8bb0a1","But I won't give up.
I'll never stop striving to become ever stronger."
"1e8baece","Sooner or later I will surpass you.
Hehe, you should prepare yourself for that day!"
"1d8bad5b","Take this."
"1c8babe8","You got Arcanalaminice!"
"1b8baa75","Can you make some space in your inventory?"
"cc559167","Oh, look who it is.
I admire your courage."
"cd5592da","But if you fail to defeat me, I will not allow you to pass."
"284de008","It's been a long time."
"2b4de4c1","I'm nothing like I was before. Do you care to find out?"
"2a4de36e","Let's fight.
I don't want to find out."
"2d4de827","Hmph, I thought I was ready, but I was clearly mistaken."
"2c4de6b4","No, I simply have to train harder."
"79a0b18a","Huh? Who is that?"
"78a0b017","Is...is it a human?"
"77a0aea4","Wow, it is!"
"76a0ad31","Or maybe..."
"75a0ab5e","No, it is a human!"
"74a0a9eb","Wow, a human!
I'm ClearAgumon!"
"73a0a878","I'm a black version of ToyAgumon.
People usually call me ToyAgumon (Black)."
"72a0a685","You can relax. We don't want to fight."
"71a0a512","But we would like to ask you something."
"749e6b74","I'll come straight out and just ask you...
Who do you think is the most popular?!"
"759e6ce7","ToyAgumon
ClearAgumon
ToyAgumon (Black)"
"33d77329","Huh? I didn't quite catch that.
Can you say it again?"
"4d5a55ac","Woohoo!!!"
"505a5a65","Huh?! No way!"
"4f5a58f2","I can't argue with that."
"4a5a50d3","You cannot be serious!"
"495a4f60","Ah..."
"ce45a379","Hmm...
I didn't expect ToyAgumon (Black) to be so shocked."
"cb459ea0","I'm sorry. I didn't realize it meant so much to him."
"cc45a013","Sorry to ask, but could you find ToyAgumon (Black) and bring
him back?"
"d145a832","I'm counting on you!"
"5b65ca9a","You've found ToyAgumon (Black)!"
"5a65c927","Hey, stay away from me!"
"5965c7b4","Approach quickly.
Walk over slowly.
Stay away."
"5865c5c1","ToyAgumon (Black) ran away!"
"5765c46e","ToyAgumon (Black) darted away!
You lost sight of him."
"5665c2fb","ToyAgumon (Black) ran into the sewer!"
"852edd07","You cornered ToyAgumon (Black)."
"862edefa","Toy Black! Cut it out! Just relax."
"872ee06d","Clear... You don't understand what it feels like...
to be an unpopular Digimon."
"802ed568","But..."
"812ed6db","We were both made as variations of ToyAgumon."
"822ed84e","At first we were popular because we were rare."
"832eda21","But people like going back to basics.
Our novelty wore off."
"7c2ecf3c","With nowhere to go, we ended up living in this sewer."
"7d2ed0af","Yeah...but we couldn't let go of our attachment to the
popularity we once had."
"a31ed1d","I'm sorry. It was stupid of us to argue about popularity."
"931ebaa","I didn't consider your feelings."
"831ea37","But...even so...you put me in last place.
That was the last straw!"
"731e844","Hey?! Come on!
Cut it out! Toy Black!"
"dcf028","Urgh... Did I lose?"
"3dcf4e1","Toy Black! Are you okay?!"
"2dcf30e","I...I think so."
"5dcf7c7","So? Have you changed your opinion of me?"
"4dcf654","It was a good effort.
You were so cool.
Hmm... Well..."
"7dcfb2d","Did you hear that, Toy Black?!
Let's get back to our life in the Drainage Path."
"6dcf9ba","Th...thank you.
I won't do anything that stupid ever again."
"f9dce523","Human, we're going back home."
"f8dce3b0","Please do come and visit us again."
"a32960c1","All right!"
"a0295c08","Seriously?! Why?!"
"a1295dfb","I agree with the human."
"a629659a","No! This isn't fair!"
"a729670d","Ah..."
"8605df54","I never expected ClearAgumon to take it so badly."
"8905e42d","I think I've messed up."
"8805e2ba","Could you find ClearAgumon and bring him back?"
"8305da9b","I'm counting on you!"
"ee3fb3cf","You found ClearAgumon!"
"ef3fb5a2","Why are you following me?!"
"f03fb715","Approach quickly.
Walk over slowly.
Stay away."
"e93fac10","ClearAgumon ran away!"
"ea3fad83","ClearAgumon darted away!
You lost sight of him."
"eb3faf76","ClearAgumon ran into the sewer!"
"1b591a02","You cornered ClearAgumon."
"1a5918af","ClearAgumon! Cut it out!
Just relax."
"1959173c","Toy Black... You don't understand what it feels like...
to be an unpopular Digimon."
"18591549","But..."
"175913d6","We were both made as variations of ToyAgumon."
"16591263","At first we were popular because we were rare."
"155910f0","But people like going back to basics.
Our novelty wore off."
"2459286d","With nowhere to go, we ended up living in this sewer."
"235926fa","Yeah...but we couldn't let go of our attachment to the
popularity we once had."
"1656d38c","I'm sorry. It was stupid of us to argue about popularity."
"1756d57f","I didn't consider your feelings."
"1856d6d2","But...even so...you put me in last place.
That was the last straw!"
"1956d845","Hey?! Come on!
Cut it out! ClearAgumon!"
"3176b01d","Urgh... No good..."
"2e76ab44","ClearAgumon! Are you okay?!"
"2f76ad37","I...I think so."
"2c76a87e","I never actually thought I could beat you, but have you
changed your opinion of me?"
"2d76a9d1","It was a good effort.
You were so cool.
Hmm... Well..."
"2a76a518","Did you hear that, ClearAgumon?!
Let's get back to our life in the Drainage Path."
"2b76a68b","Thank you.
I won't do anything that stupid ever again."
"2876a232","Human, we're going back home."
"2976a3a5","Please do come and visit us again."
"2fb10956","Ah, we've been waiting for you, human."
"2eb107e3","We want to give you these to apologize for all the trouble
we caused you."
"2db10670","You got Large Double Disk x 2!"
"34b11175","Oh... I can't give them to you?
It looks like your inventory is full."
"33b10f82","I feel there's a real bond between us now.
Come back and visit sometime."
"57e78b0b","Hi there, human. It's been a long time."
"58e78cfe","You can relax. We've been getting along great!"
"59e78e51","You can tell, right?"
"5ae78fc4","But there is just one thing we want to ask."
"5be791b7","Who do you think is the coolest?"
"d4c39a87","Wow, it's a human!
Is it a real one? Or a disguise?"
"d5c39c7a","This is Bony Resort.
It's a 24/7 resort for nutcases!"
"d6c39ded","That swirly hill is Bony Drive. There's some houses on it.
If you go to the very top, you'll find the Pink Stone House."
"cfc392e8","At the bottom of the hill is a lovely lake and tunnel.
The tunnel leads to a cemetery."
"d0c3945b","There's all sorts for you to enjoy here.
But I don't know if a human would find it fun."
"d1c395ce","To be honest, I'm not from around here.
But I fell in love with the place and decided to stay."
"d2c397a1","As for why I came here in the first place...
Well... Do you want to know?"
"cbc38cbc","Actually...someone sent me here to do some errands."
"ccc38e2f","But I lost the list with the instructions on it!"
"59c6aa9d","I still hope I can complete the errands one day."
"58c6a92a","If you happen to come across the list, do you think you
could bring it to me?"
"57c6a7b7","I'm sure I dropped it somewhere in Bony Resort.
So help me out if you think you've found it!"
"56c6a5c4","I'm sure I dropped it somewhere in Bony Resort.
So help me out if you think you've found it!"
"55c6a451","Have you found the list? Not yet?
Not that I'm bothered either way."
"9cef132c","There's a piece of paper on the ground."
"9fef17e5","Pick it up.
Don't pick it up."
"9eef1672","You got Shopping List 1!"
"99ef0e53","You got Shopping List 2!"
"98ef0ce0","You got Shopping List 3!"
"1dda60f9","Oh, have you found my list?!"
"1ada5c20","Let me see... Yeah, this is it!"
"1bda5d93","It's just..."
"20da65b2","The list had several pages.
This is only one of them."
"21da6725","You don't suppose they could've got scattered?!
I hate to trouble you, but..."
"1eda626c","You couldn't find all of them, could you?"
"1fda63df","If you're interested, I'd really appreciate it."
"38fd6936","Oh, have you found all of the pages?!"
"37fd6743","Let me see... Hmm..."
"36fd65d0","Oh, that's a shame..."
"3dfd70d5","I remember now. The list had three pages."
"3cfd6f62","I'd be great if you could find the last page."
"3bfd6d8f","You don't mind, do you? Only one more to go."
"468f1103","Oh, have you finally got them all?!"
"478f12f6","Yep, that's all three pages!"
"488f1469","Here goes..."
"498f15dc","Yay!"
"4a8f174f","The Tsukaimon tore up the list and threw it on the ground!"
"4b8f1922","The torn paper scattered like confetti."
"4c8f1a95","Congratulations!"
"4d8f1c08","Hehe, the list story was actually all a lie!
The search I sent you on was just a game I like to play."
"4e8f1dfb","I thought you'd enjoy getting to see all that Bony Resort
has to offer."
"4b915799","Here's a souvenir for you."
"4a915626","You got an MP Chip!"
"499154b3","Oh, your inventory's full.
Can you clear some space?"
"489152c0","See ya! Have a crazy night!"
"9a7f3400","Huh? Who are you?!"
"9d7f38d9","Oh, you're a human.
How dull..."
"9c7f3766","Do you know Boltmon, Myotismon, and WereGarurumon?"
"9f7f3c3f","I've been looking for them, but can't find them anywhere."
"9e7f3a4c","Aren't they some kind of famous trio in Bony Resort?"
"a17f3f05","You might have heard of them?
Frank...something...wolf...something...dra...something..."
"a07f3d92","I think they're classic monsters.
The engraving says that I must defeat them."
"a37f426b","{0} talked about Myotismon and WereGarurumon."
"a27f40f8","What? Really?!"
"b57d202a","So I'm too late."
"b67d219d","You don't know about Boltmon, do you?
He has to be somewhere."
"b37d1cc4","Can you tell me if you find him?
I hope I can at least fight Boltmon!"
"511750fb","How's the search for Boltmon going? Any clues?"
"5217526e","{0} told Youkomon the clue about Boltmon's
whereabouts."
"531753c1","Huh? What could it mean?
Could he have gone into the lake?"
"541755b4","I've never heard that he can survive underwater.
You could be mistaken."
"55175727","Sorry, but I need more clues."
"6a1da0fd","Well I never. Finally a human has made it this far."
"671d9c24","This is Absolute Zero, a frozen land of snow and ice."
"681d9d97","That structure over there is what this area is known for.
A temple called the Frost Cathedral."
"651d98de","It's pretty much the only thing here."
"661d9ab1","Anyway, there's a legend that this land suddenly appeared in
the world hundreds of years ago."
"631d95f8","So I haven't got a clue what the Frost Cathedral is."
"641d976b","You can investigate for yourself if you're interested.
You might even survive if you're lucky."
"611d9292","Speaking of which, do you wanna try your luck?
I haven't got anything better to do."
"621d9405","You know the game rock-paper-scissors, right?
Every single human knows how to play it!"
"cf207e53","Here goes!
Three, two, one..."
"ce207ce0","Rock
Scissors
Paper"
"d12081b9","{1} guessed what SnowGoblimon was
thinking, and says he'll choose ""rock."""
"d0207fc6","{1} guessed what SnowGoblimon was
thinking, and says he'll choose ""scissors."""
"d320849f","{1} guessed what SnowGoblimon was
thinking, and says he'll choose ""paper."""
"d220832c","{2} guessed what SnowGoblimon was

"d4208672","{2} guessed what SnowGoblimon was
thinking, and says he'll choose ""paper."""
"d7208acb","Rock!"
"d6208958","Scissors!"
"5d190f18","Paper!"
"5e19108b","Hahaha! I win!
Tough luck."
"5f19127e","Your partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> decreased."
"601913d1","No! I lost."
"61191544","Your partner's <icon>機嫌</icon> increased."
"62191737","Let's play again sometime. I'll beat you, no doubt about it."
"631918aa","Hmph... I won't lose next time."
"64191a1d","I just want to savor that last match a little longer.
I'll play again later."
"8ffc9261","Oh, hello there!"
"8cfc8da8","Are you planning to enter the Frost Cathedral?"
"8dfc8f1b","The Digimon inside are really strong.
The layout is also pretty complicated, so be careful."
"92fc973a","No one knows who built the Frost Cathedral or when.
Nobody even knows it's real name."
"93fc98ad","They say there's something truly dangerous sleeping in the
innermost part."
"90fc93d4","Also... No, I don't want to put you off.
You can handle yourselves!"
"91fc9547","Oh, me?"
"86fc8416","I went in once, but turned back right away.
So I don't really know what it's like in there. Hahaha."
"87fc8589","Anyway...I'm hungry."
"14ffa277","A snack. I want a snack."
"13ffa084","Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to say that out loud!"
"35c66822","You want to know about the Frost Cathedral?"
"34c6664f","Huh? You'll give me a snack?"
"33c664dc","It's not snack time yet."
"32c66369","Give him a snack.
Don't give him a snack."
"31c661f6","Wow! Thanks!"
"30c66003","You're going to make me wait?
That's harsh."
"2fc65e90","Munch munch...
Wow, this tastes great!"
"3ec6760d","Thank you.
Here, take this."
"3dc6749a","You got a Remedy Disk!"
"30c421ac","You got a Remedy Holo-Disk!"
"31c4231f","You got a Regen Disk!"
"32c424f2","You got Medicine!"
"72e2e224","Wow...
So beautiful..."
"75e2e6fd","Huh? A human?"
"74e2e50a","Were you looking at me? I don't mind.
I cannot hide such beauty."
"6fe2dd6b","I strictly manage my weight every single day to maintain my
gorgeous figure."
"6ee2dbf8","It's not simply a matter of dieting. My entire dietary
intake is controlled to achieve my ideal weight."
"71e2e0b1","But...there's one thing troubling me..."
"70e2dede","My weight fluctuates while I'm collecting ingredients.
That makes it very complicated to stay exactly on target."
"6be2d73f","It's all so bothersome... Oh, I've just had an idea!"
"6ae2d54c","Being a Tamer, you must know a thing or two about nutrition?"
"6de09bae","Could you bring me the food I need?
You will be a patron of my beauty. Hehehe. How about it?"
"6ee09d01","I'll give it a try.
No thanks."
"6be09848","You seem confident.
I expect great things."
"6ce09a3b","Well...if you don't think you're up to the task..."
"aedda59f","Now then..."
"afdda772","I want to lose five G.
Bring me three ingredients within 24 hours."
"b0dda8e5","I want to gain five G.
Bring me three ingredients within 24 hours."
"a9dd9de0","I want to lose three G.
Bring me three ingredients within 24 hours."
"aadd9f53","I want to gain three G.
Bring me three ingredients within 24 hours."
"aedda59e","I'm counting on you to get the total exactly right."
"abdda0c6","I want to lose five G.
I need three ingredients. I'm counting on you."
"acdda2b9","I want to gain five G.
I need three ingredients. I'm counting on you."
"b5ddb084","I want to lose three G.
I need three ingredients. I'm counting on you."
"b6ddb277","I want to gain three G.
I need three ingredients. I'm counting on you."
"a9827712","Have you brought them?"
"a88275bf","Give me the first one."
"a78273cc","Now for the second one."
"a6827259","Finally, give me the third one."
"a58270e6","Are you giving up? Pull yourself together!"
"a4826f73","That's all of them.
Okay...let me check."
"a3826d80","The total is... Yeah, exactly right!"
"b282857d","The total is... Sadly I haven't met my target."
"b182838a","The total is... Sadly I've gone over my target."
"a480309c","Hehe, excellent job.
You've helped me maintain my beauty. You must feel honored?"
"a580320f","I must say I'm very disappointed in you.
You have to up your game."
"a68033e2","Here's your reward."
"a7803555","You got 5,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"a0802a50","I will ask for your help again."
"a1802bc3","You still want to contribute to my beauty?
I can't store the ingredients for long. Come back tomorrow."
"a2802db6","Too bad, time's up!"
"5843502f","Hmm... Now I combine the mark with the spell...
And my hands go like this... Or is it like this?"
"59435182","Oh? What a peculiar visitor."
"5a435375","Fancy a practicing human Tamer showing up like this.
Your timing is impeccable."
"53434870","As you can see, I am a Digimon that uses magic.
I spend my days engrossed in magical research."
"544349e3","Any Digimon can fight.
What I seek is something far different."
"55434b56","In short, my field is movement magic."
"56434cc9","I would like to request your help.
Will you hear me out?"
"5f435b14","I'll cast a movement spell on you, and then you'll come
right back and tell me where you ended up."
"60435c87","That's it.
I'll pay you each time."
"dd466025","There's nothing to worry about.
You won't be in any danger. My magic is completely safe."
"e65c734","So will you do it?"
"1165cb8d","Okay, I'm in.
Not right now."
"1065ca1a","Great, I'll send you away...
Make sure you come back within 24 hours."
"b65c27b","Raaaaaah!"
"a65c088","Not ready yet?
Come back when you are prepared."
"d65c541","Oh, would you like to help with another movement experiment?"
"382ed9a1","Oh, you're back."
"352ed4e8","{0} told Sorcermon about the destination!"
"362ed65b","I see...
I need to improve the accuracy."
"3b2ede7a","Thank you for your help. It went as I expected.
Here, take this."
"3c2edfed","You got Crystallumagite!"
"392edb14","Your inventory is full.
Can you sort it out?"
"3a2edc87","Let me know if you'd like to help out again."
"2f2ecb56","Have you made space in your inventory for your reward?"
"302eccc9","Too bad. You didn't make it in time.
I'm a stickler for rules, so no reward this time."
"13ab8592","We've been waiting for you...{0}."
"12ab843f","Do you know who we are?"
"11ab824c","Kuro-rin... Hehe, that name doesn't suit you anymore."
"10ab80d9","You're right, Kuro-cchi. Now we're the strongest of all,
maybe we should come up with new names."
"fab7f66","We've been training like crazy since last time."
"eab7df3","After risking life and limb, and pushing ourselves to the
brink, we finally Digivolved into our current forms."
"dab7c00","Today we finally bring our long struggle with you to an end."
"1cab93fd","Everyone will know that we are the strongest!"
"1bab920a","Now you come here for a rematch.
This can only end badly for you!"
"7a88d3d1","No... We...lost..."
"7788cf18","Is this it...for us...?"
"7888d08b","No... Not yet...
There's one...last hope..."
"7d88d8aa","You're right... Our last resort..."
"7e88da1d","Uwooooh!"
"7b88d544","Waaaah!"
"7c88d737","Kwaaa...aaa!"
"7188c586","Ye...Yes! It's happening!"
"7288c779","Di...Did it work?!"
"7f8b1a67","Huh?!"
"7e8b18f4","Was that it?"
"818b1d4d","It didn't last long."
"808b1bda","Ha...hahaha...
We gave it all we've got, Kuro-rin."
"7b8b143b","Yeah, but there was a small miracle at the end,
Kuro-cchi."
"7a8b1248","You've been a great help, {0}."
"7d8b1701","As we promised, it's over."
"7c8b15ae","But..."
"778b0d8f","Oh, no, we don't want to fight anymore."
"768b0c1c","You are the strongest combination.
That's clear. We admit it 100%."
"ed83788c","That makes us the world's number two!
We won't let anyone take that from us!"
"ee837a7f","Hahaha, see ya."
"d8033cb0","It wasn't fancy enough for a city or anything.
If it's broken this bad I can't fix it."
"db034109","Even if it's a wreck, I like it..."
"da033f96","If it's broken I'll just fix it.
No need to rush."
"d90e4bed","It wasn't fancy enough for a city or anything.
If it's broken this bad I can't fix it."
"d60e4714","Even if it's a wreck, I like it..."
"d70e4887","If it's broken I'll just fix it.
No need to rush."
"3068345e","I'm starvin'!"
"2f6832eb","The fighting's done...
Now I can stuff my face with meat!"
"2e683178","The Veggie Troops are too strong!
​They're gonna take the fortress..."
"35683c7d","The Ohguino Wastelands war is over, but your war is still
going on, eh? Good luck."
"34683a8a","Actually I kind of like vegetables...but those Veggie creeps
are trying to eliminate all meat!"
"33683917","Now we can eat as much meat and vegetables as we want!
Isn't peace great?"
"326837a4","It looks like the Veggie Troops are planning something big.
Damn, we've got to do something!"
"29682959","So the Veggie Troops were planning to burn this land with a
laser cannon, huh? Thanks for saving our bacon!"
"73610b1b","Huh? Is that meat I smell?
You're not from the enemy army, are you?"
"74610c8e","Nothing to report here... Guess there's no need to keep a
guard here anymore, eh? Ha ha ha."
"75610e61","You guys want to join the Veggie Troops? You'll never make
it with the ladies eating nasty stuff like meat."
"76610fd4","The Veggie Troops may have been beaten, but I'm still never
gonna eat meat."
"77611147","The Ohguino Wastelands will soon belong to the Veggie
Troops! The Meaty Troops are nothing!"
"7861133a","Nothing sadder than a lord losing his castle..."
"796114ad","The Veggie Troops are intelligent and pure... They'll never
get along with those stupid, savage Meaty Troops."
"6a60fd30","So someone was pulling Lady Rosemon's strings from the
shadows... I'm shocked..."
"6b60fea3","As long as we've got this sturdy castle, the Veggie Troops
will never lose!"
"f8641b11","We plan to protect this castle and keep it beautiful."
"f76419be","WE ARE FROM THE NEXT AREA OVER. THE VEGGIE TROOPS HIRED US
AS MERCENARIES."
"f66417cb","WE WERE MERCENARIES... I WONDER IF IT'S OKAY TO LEAVE NOW?"
"12462eb4","Just make sure you don't offend Lady Rosemon."
"1546330d","Is Lady Rosemon well?"
"1446319a","Compared to the beauty of Lady Rosemon, you're not much to
look at..."
"f4629fb","I will follow Lady Rosemon's orders and remain here."
"6ea64c31","This Crimson Shrine is dedicated to fires and mountains.
Who built it? I think it was always here."
"6ba64778","It is thanks to the Crimson Shrine that we the people of
Logic Volcano live normal lives."
"6ca648eb","There is nothing special inside the Crimson Shrine.
The building itself protects the land."
"b2dc5722","The pirates have gone.
But we stay here because we have no homes to return to."
"b1dc554f","The fearsome MOD Ship Pirates!
Ah, those were the days..."
"b0dc53dc","IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF PIRATES, THIS ROOM WAS OVERFLOWING 
WITH GOLD. NOW IT IS COLD AND EMPTY."
"98f2f6ff","YOU HAVE A REQUEST FOR THE CONTROL CENTER?"
"99f2f852","WE NOW MANAGE THE LAND FLOATING SYSTEM."
"9af2f9c5","IT IS DIVIDED BY A FAULT. YOU WISH TO GO TO THE NORTH LAND?
PLEASE CHANGE THE LANDING PATTERN."
"93f2eec0","IT IS DIVIDED BY A FAULT. YOU WISH TO GO TO THE NORTH LAND?
THE LANDING PATTERN HAS BEEN CHANGED."
"b7474688","Har har, bustin' into a person's house like that!
Funky!"
"ba474b41","Mwa ha ha! Crazy customers like you need to leave if you've
got no business here."
"b94749ee","Man, isn't it payday yet?!"
"bc474ea7","Aww man, I really wish I didn't have to work so hard!"
"bb474d34","Whaaa...! With no appointment...
How rude!"
"be47518d","Whaaa...! With no invitation?!
How rude!"
"bd47501a","...
Keep the room clean. Please."
"126a2f85","Let us pray. May he reach Heaven..."
"f6a2acc","This temple simply appeared one day.
It is without doubt a gift from Heaven."
"106a2cbf","There's a demon sleeping deep in the temple?
You've got to be joking!"
"d6a27e6","This Frost Cathedral teaches that ""Absolute Zero is
absolute."" We all put our faith in that."
"e6a2959","Aren't you cold?
Humans are really mysterious creatures."
"b6a2480","You see nothing?
Look not with your eyes, but with your faith."
"6469c242","You cannot hold any more items."
"9663b666","Who the heck're you, hmph?! This is my sacred poop pile!"
"9563b4f3","This is the king's realm, where only those who pay tribute
may enter, hmph!"
"9463b300","I won't hear any explanations! Go on, get outta here! Hmph!"
"852a87b3","Warnings about the Field"
"852a87b2","From here on out, Digimon will appear that attack you as
enemies."
"852a87b1","Enemy Digimon react when you approach them. They will chase
you, and touching one will start a battle."
"852a87b0","A Digimon that doesn't react may be one that'll come to the
city. Talk to them with <icon>○</icon>, or get close to trigger an event."
"852a87b7","There's a Digimon nearby! Now, is it friend, or foe...?"
"852a87b6","City Prosperity and DigiMail"
"852a87b5","The wild Digimon decided to join the city! Now let's find
some partner Digimon and bring them back."
"852a87b4","Also, the DigiMail mark appeared in the lower right corner.
A notice will display whenever a DigiMail is delivered."
"852a87bb","Open your Digivice with <icon>△</icon> and try reading your DigiMail."
"842a85c1","Find Ingredients and Materials!"
"a028735f","The explanation was interrupted, so it will restart.
(Moving to the point where the interruption occurred.)"
"842a85c2","There are points in the field where ingredients drop and
materials can be found."
"842a85c3","This area has an ingredient (Digistalk) and a material
(Metal). Now, try getting some ingredients and materials!"
"842a85c4","Touch Ingredient or Material circles to display a
confirmation window. You can press <icon>○</icon> to take the item."
"842a85c5","Mushrooms, fruit, and other ingredients will drop in the
field."
"842a85c6","Gather as many as you can to stave off your partner
Digimon's hunger."
"842a85c7","Materials aren't too useful at first, but they'll be needed
to develop the city later on."
"842a85c8","The amount you can have changes depending on the Stamina of
your partner Digimon."
"842a85c9","When you return to the city, they are automatically placed
into city storage."
"872a8a98","World Connections"
"872a8a9b","This world is vast, and contains a multitude of areas,
each of which is split into several smaller areas."
"872a8a9a","The farther you go, the stronger your enemies become.
You must build up the strength of your partners."
"872a8a9d","For now, let's go to Nigh Plains and get used to living with
your partner Digimon."
"862a8927","Digimon Battles (Continued)"
"862a8924","Now then, there's a hostile Digimon right over there!"
"862a8925","You won't be able to cross the bridge unless you defeat
it first!"
"862a8922","I'll take this opportunity to explain more about battle
controls and strategy."
"862a8923","I've filled up your partner's HP and MP. Let's use this
battle to learn how things work!"
"862a8920","OP (Order Power) at Battle Start"
"862a8921","OP gained in battle will not carry over to the next battle.
It will reset to the base value every time."
"862a892e","The base value of partner OP at the start of battle
increases the higher your Bond is with your partners."
"862a892f","What's more, if you battle a lot in a short time, you will
gain five bonus OP for each partner."
"892a8dff","The more OP you have at the start, the more decisively you
can fight. Use this to your advantage!"
"a3da2db8","Oh...you came, {0}! I've been waiting for you."
"a3da2db9","This place may look like Infinite Cauldron, but it seems
we're in a different dimension."
"a3da2dba","There are limits to how long you can be here...plus you
can't make any records."
"a3da2dbb","It seems like a pretty nasty place...
We'll have to be careful."
"a3da2dbc","The one we're after is farther inside... I don't know what
kind of enemies we'll face on the way, though."
"a3da2dbd","Each area isn't that big. Let's split up so we don't get in
each other's way."
"a3da2dbe","All right, see you up ahead!"
"a3da2dbf","Warning!
You cannot save your game here."
"65fca7d2","I'M BORED... PLAY WITH ME?"
"65fca7d3","THAT WAS FUN!"
"ccad6de3","YOU CAME... LET'S HAVE FUN!"
"ccad6de2","YOU ARE STRONG! I AM SATISFIED."
"d3ad78e1","You cleared Dimension M! Returning to the city."
"aec12b8f","MORE... GIVE ME MORE BATTLE ENERGY!!!"
"aec12b8e","MUHAHAHA, HOW BRILLIANT!"
"c85f4e1e","I don't know what to do with such power right after waking
up. Perhaps you could battle with me?"
"c85f4e1f","Great, {0}! I expected no less from you, human."
"c15f4310","You cleared Dimension G! Returning to the city."
"3b876890","You've come, have you? I remember...someone rewrote my
battle brain..."
"3b876892","I was transformed into a machine that would not stop
destroying until this world was no more..."
"3b876893","Thanks to you, I was released from that state! Allow me to
fight you as my way of saying thanks!"
"3b876891","Come take on this overwhelming battle power anytime!"
"c0fb2c41","...!!!
(^ ^)"
"c0fb2c40","...!!!
m(_ _)m"
"b7fb1e7f","You cleared Dimension T! Returning to the city."
"f0e5e165","Ho... I desire combat."
"f0e5e164","That was a good fight..."
"a3451d4","Rather, I was soundly defeated. Allow me to get straight to
the point."
"a3451d5","Muwahaha! That made my blood boil! How satisfying."
"33446e6","You cleared Dimension P! Returning to the city."
"966bdbbe","You enjoying yourself, {0}?
Let me have some fun, too!"
"966bdbbf","You've gotten better again. I'd better get serious myself!"
"fcccefaf","Now come, turn this battle into strength!"
"fcccefae","What a great battle. Like justice transformed into power
itself!"
"3ccfa9d","You cleared Dimension E! Returning to the city."
"2533dafb","You've come, child... You'll help me with my research, won't
you?"
"2533dafa","Mwahaha, very well! This magical metamorphosis... What
exceptional results...!"
"f87ecfca","Yo, {0}, I'm happy you came all this way!"
"f87ecfcb","This space is really strange... In this form, my power is
unlimited."
"f17ec4cc","You cleared Dimension Z! Returning to the city."
"2b6de9c4","You've come all this way, have you? Allow me to help you.
Nnnn...SHAAA!"
"2b6de9c5","60 seconds restored!"
"2b6de9c6","All right, now go. Don't go wasting that precious time."
"d871dd15","Ha ha ha, you've done well to get here. Now, accept my
fighting spirit!"
"d871dd14","Partner <icon>機嫌</icon> maxed out!"
"d871dd17","Heh, now rout the enemy with that spirit!"
"ec9ec0e2","I shall bestow my power upon you. Take it!"
"ec9ec0e3","Partner STR and WIS raised by 50!"
"ec9ec0e0","You cannot overestimate yourself simply because your ability
has increased."
"26490eb3","I shall give you some time... However...you don't think that
comes for free, do you?"
"26490eb2","120 seconds restored!
10,000 <icon>BIT</icon> stolen!"
"26490eb1","Ha ha ha, I told you it wasn't free!"
"26490eb0","120 seconds restored!
All of your <icon>BIT</icon> were stolen!"
"3a75f200","You've come at a good time. I want you to take these..."
"3a75f201","You got several items!"
"3a75f202","Bringing only what you need in your inventory will prevent
wasting your items."
"63ce371","You've done well to make it here! I'll give you this power!"
"63ce370","Partner HP and MP raised by 200, and STR, STA, WIS and SPD
raised by 20!"
"63ce373","My power is for the future... You must be steadfast in all
things."
"34062dfe","You're quite the lucky one. I'll impart a fraction of my
wealth to you here and now."
"34062dff","You got 30,000 <icon>BIT</icon>!"
"34062dfc","Now go, any more and I'll consider you quite greedy."
"9a6741ef","Hee hee, you've got a good look in your eyes, as usual. Let
me help you out a little."
"9a6741ee","Partner Bond, DigiFriend and <icon>機嫌</icon> raised by 20!"
"9a6741ed","Hmm, that wasn't too helpful, you say? My bad!"
"81dd5f1c","Oh, we meet again. Let me do something to help you out."
"81dd5f1d","You got DigiHolywater, DigiDiamond, Blue Digizoit and
DigiGodwood x 2!"
"81dd5f1e","Oh, this isn't what you were expecting? Well, doing the same
thing as everyone else won't help, will it?"
"81dd5f1f","Oh, we meet again.
Hehe, I'm a little wild today."
"81dd5f18","You got DigiHolywater, DigiDiamond, Blue Digizoit and
DigiGodwood x 3!"
"81dd5f19","It's a little more than usual.
That's the power of Burst Mode!"
"83ea5ad","You've made it this far, so you can take a break. Here, let
me lend you some strength."
"83ea5ac","Partner MP raised by 500, and SPD raised by 50!"
"83ea5af","This dimension is really weird... It gives me access to a
region of power I normally cannot manifest."
"df9c19a7","In this space, I can even perform feats such as this...
Heh, go on. Take it."
"df9c19a6","Partner Life raised slightly!"
"df9c19a5","Whew, did it work?"
"a07b8336","I'd say it's time to show my power! This golden armor ain't
just for show, y'know!"
"a07b8337","You got 1,000 <icon>LUCK</icon>!"
"a07b8334","Gold brings good luck, y'know!"
"72b23849","I don't really understand it, but...my Royal Knight power...
it's...WOOOOOOH!"
"72b23848","A random amount of time was restored!"
"72b2384b","This power has yet to stabilize... I have to consult the
others on how to control it."
"c5fdf718","Hmm... You have quite a bit of time remaining, in a way.
In that case, how about this?"
"c5fdf719","60 seconds lost!
Partner Life raised slightly!"
"c5fdf71a","Heh heh... Better hurry up... Sometimes if you chase two
rabbits you can catch both, if you're good enough."
"b18161ab","I acknowledge your effort! Here, for further endeavors!"
"b18161aa","Partner HP raised by 500, and STA raised by 50!"
"b18161a9","Continue to persevere. This will become the power that
carves out the path of your destiny."
"f825fc7a","Ho ho ho... Let me increase your time. But in exchange..."
"f825fc7b","120 seconds restored!
Partner HP and MP stolen!"
"f825fc78","Sorry if that was a bit sudden. Still, a small price to pay,
don't you think?"
"63aa300d","I'm training here so I can beat you next time.
You'd better make yourself stronger! Take this."
"63aa300c","Tamer experience increased by 2,000!"
"63aa300f","I haven't trained enough to beat you yet.
But I will defeat you one day!"
"63aa300e","Your Tamer level is maxed out.
Never mind. Take this instead."
"63aa3009","You got 1,000 <icon>LUCK</icon>!"
"5e8554fc","Have you come to see me?
Hehe, you won't regret it...probably."
"5e8554fd","You got HP Chip x 1!"

"5e8554fb","You couldn't carry any more, so didn't get anything!"
"5e8554f4","I hope you got what you wanted.
Did you?"
"5e8554f5","Bad luck.
But it's all down to destiny."
"92cbe46","It's a vending machine."
"92cbe47","A vending machine. Has ""Prizes inside!"" written on it."
"92cbe44","Oh! You won!!!"
"92cbe45","You got Phantom Nectar x 1!"
"122ccc98","You can't carry any more items, so the transaction was
