"e3da713e","Hey there! Finally..."
"e2da6f4b","Glad you made it, my little apprentice!"
"e1da6dd8","I'm Rina.
And this is Veevee!"
"e8da78dd","Okay then!
Let's start off with some lessons!"
"e7da776a","Why are you just standing there gaping like that?
You saw it, right? The DigiMail?"
"e6da75f7","You're good enough to qualify as an apprentice to a top-
level Tamer like me!"
"e5da7404","Hm? Why do you need to have two partners? It bothers you,
right?"
"dcda6639","Now that we're on the same page, here's what you need to do
for training!"
"dbda6446","Drum roll, please! Ta-da!"
"5ed76128","It says to do ten training sessions!"
"5fd7629b","A Tamer is nothing without training!
Don't worry though, it's a piece of cake!"
"60d7640e","Come back here when you're done! Seriously!
Get going, now!"
"18b347eb","How's it going, little apprentice?
Your training's on track?"
"19b3495e","Not done yet?!
Get on it!"
"4abe6e70","Okay, little apprentice!
Looks like you are done with your ten sessions!"
"4dbe72c9","I like your attitude!
Way to go!"
"4cbe7156","So your next session...
What's with that face? What?"
"4fbe762f","Oh, you want a reward?
Let me think..."
"4ebe74bc","Well done! Excellent! Good job!"
"51be7975","..."
"50be7782","Sorry... Really...
You will get compensation, for sure..."
"53be7c5b","Hey, Veevee, don't go soft on my apprentice!
A Tamer's road is a hard one."
"52be7ae8","Okay, okay, as I was saying!
Your next session!"
"65bc5a1a","Drum roll, please! Ta-da!"
"66bc5b8d","It says to collect 30 Digistalks!"
"63bc5734","Tamers have got to collect food
so they can keep their partner's belly full!"
"64bc58a7","Well then, off with you!
Yeah!"
"682c5e1d","Hey, how'd you do? You collected them all?!
30 Digistalks!"
"652c5944","Not yet!
If you don't hurry up, I'll find you a weird nickname!"
"520ec802","Hey, apprentice of mine!
You did it, didn't you?"
"510ec6af","I count... 30 Digistalks!
Thanks!"
"500ec53c","Smile! This time I have a real reward for you.
Hang on just a sec..."
"4f0ec349","Here it is!"
"4e0ec1d6","You received 30 Digistalks!"
"4d0ec063","What?
I'd thought you'd be happier than that!"
"4c0ebef0","You say these are just the 30 Digistalks you brought me?
No, no! Look here!"
"5b0ed66d","See? These have my autograph!
That's cool, right?"
"5a0ed4fa","That makes them worth a lot more!
You could put a few of them up for auction..."
"4d0c818c","..."
"4e0c837f","Sorry, sorry! You're probably too choked up to speak, right?
On to the next training session?"
"4f0c84d2","Drum roll, please! Ta-da!"
"500c8645","It says to bring a Super Regen Disk, a Super Double
Disk, and a Full Remedy Disk!"
"490c7b40","They're all top-grade and really rare!
Things a Tamer would want to have on hand!"
"4a0c7d33","Off with you, apprentice! I mean, my precious little
apprentice! You should be able to do this one easily!"
"24f561cf","You already got them?!
You're unbelievable!"
"25f563a2","But no! Not yet!
It's so easy to get them confused. Bring the right ones!"
"26f56515","You need a Super Regen Disk, a Super Double Disk, and a Full Remedy Disk!"
"bcbb8d54","What's this?! You got 'em!
Show me, show me!"
"bfbb922d","That's a Super Regen Disk, a Super Double Disk, and a
Full Remedy Disk, for sure!"
"bebb90ba","Well, that cinches it... Yeah...
I'm glad I asked you... You were the right choice!"
"b9bb889b","Let me just autograph these...
What's that? No? Oh, really?"
"b8bb8728","Um, okay then. The next training session...
This one is a little crazy..."
"bbbb8be1","Come back tomorrow.
Today you should rest up, my dear apprentice..."
"d9df0ec1","Not yet, dear apprentice!
Calm yourself down!"
"1b32a93","Here we go! Here we go! ...Wha'?!"
"2b32c06","Why's your inventory full?! Didn't I tell you to make some
space?!"
"3b32df9","Hm? I didn't? You sure? Ah, darnit!"
"4b32f6c","Well, you didn't really need me to say it, though, right?
You should want to impress me by reading my mind!"
"5b330df","What are you waiting for?! Clear some space already!"
"4068869","You're here! My dear apprentice!"
"1068390","I can't believe you made it this far!"
"2068503","But I can't start crying yet!"
"7068d22","Here's your final training session!
Let's skip the drum roll this time."
"8068e95","It's time to fight the best of the best!
UlforceVeedramon, also known as Veevee!"
"50689dc","You're not ready yet?! Whoa!
A trainer should always be ready to fight!"
"6068b4f","That was pretty cool, what I just said!
I can't believe I said that!"
"b06936e","Okay, then! Start fighting!"
"a40e331c","That's enough!"
"a70e37d5","Way to go, dear apprentice...
You defeated Veevee! Of all Digimon!"
"a60e3662","Hey!"
"a10e2e43","Excellent! Off the hook!"
"a00e2cd0","Hahahaha!
I can finally tell you the truth!"
"a30e31a9","Yeah, it all started when I intercepted Mirei's rescue
signal..."
"a20e3036","After crossing the stormy digital seas, Veevee and I arrived
here... That's when it happened."
"ad0e4167","Just when I thought we had passed the digital border...
We somehow got caught on something..."
"ac0e3ff4","The border closed us off!
We got caught up in some complex digital thing..."
"9f0bec86","To make a long story short, we got stuck.
And now we can't leave."
"a00bee79","But don't tell Mirei that! I'm too embarrassed!
I haven't been able to reach Mirei, either!"
"9d0be9a0","That's when I found you!"
"9e0beb13","According to Veevee, if we take a really big hit, something
will come loose."
"a30bf332","That's how we came up with the idea of building you up to
knock Veevee really hard. Yeah, I'm a genius, I know."
"a40bf4a5","So when you succeeded so well before, we knew you could
rescue us. And you did!"
"a10befec","But you ended up getting built up by a top-grade, pretty
little Tamer like me, so it's not all bad, right?"
"a20bf15f","I see..."
"a70bf97e","No way! Mirei?!"
"a80bfad1","Heehee! I guess I should thank you for the help, Rina."
"39090dbd","Um... How long have you been wise to us?"
"38090bca","For a little while now, I guess.
Been too busy to come say hello, though. Sorry about that!"
"37090a57","Darn... I thought I was getting away with it."
"360908e4","It was a pretty good idea, to use that to 
help you escape... Very impressive indeed."
"35090771","What's this?"
"3409059e","Sorry if that was a little abrupt. I wanted to get you all
outside for a bit."
"3309042b","What? Really?!"
"320902b8","Hey, apprentice! Now's your chance! Take this!"
"310900c5","I'll be back!"
"3008ff52","So sorry about that. Oh well, she... could be called an
acquaintance of mine, I suppose."
"3306c5b4","She'll be back in this Digital World, though. I don't think
she'd want to leave a beloved apprentice all alone, right?"
"3406c727","You received Indicaesquetrine from Rina."
"3506c89a","You cleared the Add-On Scenario
""The Most Beautiful Tamer Ever Arrives!"""
"6196bbb4","Hey, {0}! My dear apprentice!
How cool is it that we get to meet again?"
"6496c00d","Not that cool?
I'm so sorry! But you really helped us out!"
"6396be9a","We might have been stuck there forever!"
"5e96b6fb","So, give us a chance to explore this world a little.
We're counting on you!"
"5d96b508","We might be able to help you out a little.
When that time comes, count on us!"
"bbcc661f","Hey, there! How goes it, apprentice?"
"bccc67f2","Thanks, and, uh, yeah, it's all good.
Rina is looking out for me."
"bdcc6965","Hey, Mameo! You should go up against Veevee next time."
"b6cc5e60","Whoa! Don't be so rude, Rina!"
"b6cc5e65","UlforceVeedramon? No problem...but I'll just need a little
time."
"b7cc5fd3","What did Mirei call it? Her Devil-Angel-Lady-Woman?
Where did that go?"
"b8cc6146","Rina... I would knock it off with that name..."
"b8cc6143","Mastemon...I'm sorry. You've been surpassed..."
"b9cc6339","Yeah, okay. This world is a little like the world I used to
be in..."
"c2cc7104","I haven't seen those folks in a while. I wonder how everyone's
doing."
"c3cc72f7","Hey, there! Prosperity in town has reached the max?
Take this, then!"
"c0ceac95","You got Indicaesquetrine!"
"bfceab22","Thank you for letting me meet so many Digimon!"
"b96d9ee5","...? And you are?
"
"b66d9a2c","I'm {0}.
I got your DigiMail.
I'm nobody."
"b76d9b9f","{0}? 'Kay."
"b46d96c6","DigiMail...? I don't remember...sending one...
"
"b56d98b9","Nobody? Strange name..."
"b26d93e0","Umm... Lemme think... Oh yeah!
"
"b36d9553","...?"
"c06da9ea","Can I...ask you a favor?"
"c16dab5d","There's a...scary Digimon...in the Vast...Plateau...?
The place...with the trees..."
"be6fe57b","You...strong...? If so...take care of...Digimon..."
"bd6fe388","Please...I'll be waiting...
"
"fa3c2f8","Still there...?"
"12a3c7b1","Please...do it quickly..."
"e354a513","Huh? What do you want, human?"
"e454a686","Um... Would you mind leaving?
What are you doing here?
Meicoomon said you were scary."
"e554a879","Whoa, what's this about? Are you accusing me of doing
something?"
"e654a9ec","What am I doing? Nothing in particular.
"
"e754ab5f","Meicoo? What the heck?"
"e854ad32","Wait...! Don't tell me..."
"e954aea5","That weird little creepy thing is your friend?! Nnraaar!
You've got some nerve!"
"d7003146","Hold on just a second...
"
"d6002fd3","If you're really Meicoo's friend, then tell me something.
What's going on?"
"d5002e60","Meicoo was lost and hungry, so I was trying to help it."
"dc003965","My head suddenly started hurting and I blacked out for
a while."
"db0037f2","When I came round the food I'd gotten was gone! It's my
fault, I guess, for being so gullible..."
"da00361f","Are you sure you're not just being duped too? You look
pretty gullible."
"d90034ac","Yeowch! I'm getting out of here. See ya later! Watch your
back!"
"2f8f66c9","Phew... You're back...
"
"2c8f6270","Has that Digimon...left?"
"2d8f63e3","Yeah, it's gone.
It told me something interesting...
The real criminal is you!"
"328f6b82","Thank you..."
"338f6d75","Something interesting...?"
"308f68bc","Criminal...?"
"318f6a2f","Um... Y'know...to tell you the truth... I can't really...
remember anything..."
"368f71ce","Who is this place...? Where's my name...? Hey...
Do you know...?"
"378f73a1","...!"
"b49276df","...!"
"b392756c","I can...see...

"af926f20","...a long...bridge?"

"b1927206","Go find it...! It's gotta be...important...!"
"afe14dfc","Greenery...soil...a waterfall...?"
"b2e152b5","A fence...? A long...bridge...?"
"b1e150c2","Go find it...! It's gotta be...important...!"
"72c66317","(There's something on the ground.)"
"73c6648a","(Looks like a scrap of paper with something written on it.
Could it be from someone's diary?)"
"74c6667d","""I'm in another world...find a way back... Gotta hurry..."""
"6dc65b78","""Still have the strength...before they get here..."""
"6ec65ceb","(Does this belong to Meicoomon? This could be important.)"
"6fc65e5e","It's here. I'm picking up the last traces of data waves.
Looks like there was a battle..."
"70c66031","It can't have ended well... We have to hurry."
"69c654cc","Wait. Over there.
"
"6ac656bf","What?! There are humans in this world, too?!"
"77c8a9ad","Hey, you there. I want to ask you something."
"76c8a83a","Huh? What's that you're holding?"
"75c8a647","That might be what we've been looking for. Can I take a look?"
"74c8a4d4","..."
"73c8a361","Um, Captain, you might want to be leave that well alone!"
"72c8a18e","Gah! I touched it!"
"71c8a01b","...?!"
"70c89ea8","St-Stop...! Stop that!"
"6fc89d35","We're too late! Hey, you, give me that!"
"6ec89b42","You shouldn't do that without a force field! Oh boy...
"
"ddcb88f6","Why so strong?! We have to hurry..."
"decb8a69","Arrrgh..."
"dbcb8590","We should get out of here right now, and report back."
"dccb8703","(What was all that about? I should go see Meicoomon.)"
"f5596f2a","I knew you'd come back. You won't get away again."
"f4596db7","This isn't personal. I just need that scrap of paper."
"49cdd89d","Did you...find anything?!"
"46cdd3c4","({0} explained everything that had happened.)"
"47cdd5b7","What...? A different world...?"
"44cdd0fe","I'm probably...being targeted...?"
"45cdd251","Hmm..."
"42cdcd98","Human...? I..."
"43cdcf0b","...?!"
"40cdcab2","There you are!"
"41cdcc25","Don't move!"
"2ecfecf3","We're using a force field, so any attempts to resist will be
futile."
"2dcfeb00","You're coming with us."
"30cfefd9","Why...? I..."
"2fcfee66","Agh!"
"32cff33f","!"
"31cff14c","*pant* *pant*"
"34cff605","What the?!"
"33cff492","I said don't move..."
"36cff96b","Aaaagh!"

"c2c886ca","Huh...? Where am I...?"
"c3c888bd","You're...a human..."
"b4c870c0","Have you gotten your memory back?
Have you gotten your sanity back?
Do you even know who you are?"
"b5c872b3","Memory..."
"c2cac5a1","Sanity..."
"c1cac3ce","You...?"
"c0cac25b","I...remember...!"
"bfcac0e8","I...I'm sorry..."
"c6cacbed","I'm being...called back..."
"c5caca7a","...to the other...world..."
"c4cac887","Farewell... Thanks..."
"c3cac714","Meicoomon placed something on the ground before
disappearing."
"bacab8c9","Meicoomon left an item behind."
"b9cab756","You got Feliprudentite!"
"c0d78e6e","Meicoomon left an item behind, but your inventory is full..."
"c1d78fc1","You cleared the Add-On Scenario ""Meicoomon's Riddle""!"
"2c5fe8f0","..."
"2f5fed49","!"
"497ada40","Welcome! There's something big happening that requires your
skills."
"4c7adf19","It appears that the Three Gods of Ruin--Kuzuhamon,
Samudramon, and Titamon--have been reincarnated."
"4b7adda6","Why hadn't they come back until now? It's possible their
data's corrupted..."
"4e7ae27f","However, there may be another reason. We're trying our best
to get a fix on their locations."
"4d7ae08c","If they intend to wreak havoc on the world again, then we
have to put a stop to their plans as soon as possible."
"507ae545","Noir and I will go and speak to them. The way I am right
now, I can't do this by myself."
"4f7ae3d2","We may end up asking you for your help if things go south.
Don't worry. I realize I can't do everything by myself."
"527ae8ab","We have a fix on one of them."
"517ae738","There's a strong signal coming from Absolute Zero."
"6478c66a","Yeah, you're right... It's gotta be Titamon."
"6578c7dd","We'll head out right away."
"6278c304","What about the others?"
"6378c4f7","Nothing we can verify just yet."
"6078c03e","I see... Could you head out too, {0}?"
"6178c191","I know Tsuzuki's matured, but when it comes to inviting
Digimon to join the city, you're the most reliable."
"5e78bcd8","...!"
"5f78be4b","What the...?! You want to bring the Three Gods of Ruin
to the city?!"
"5c78b9f2","Sounds like a good idea to me."
"5d78bb65","Granted it won't be easy, but all things considered it's the
best thing for Floatia."
"de75b4e1","Y'know, the Three Gods of Ruin ain't got nothing on you,
{0}. You could handle a Hundred Gods of Ruin!"
"dd75b30e","Huh? Oh yeah, what about...?"
"dc75b19b","What about what...? Oh, MetalEtemon?!"
"db75b028","Yeah, they may have reincarnated together..."
"e275bb2d","Okay, we should search for them at the same time."
"b33637ad","Outta my way. I don't know who you are, but I'll slash you
if you don't back off."
"b03632d4","Don't be like that, Titamon! I don't want to fight you."
"b1363447","You've got some nerve, human. What do you want?"
"ae362f8e","What?! It's me, Shoma! Don't you recognize me?"
"af363161","Shoma... It looks like this Titamon has lost its memory."
"ac362ca8","Is that possible? If so, then we're in trouble right now..."
"ad362e1b","It's possible its memory hasn't fully returned yet. Maybe
we should step back."
"aa362942","Tch. Another human? What's going on...?"
"ab362b35","Huh?! My Zanjinto's upset? What's happening?!"
"18391503","Leave this to me, {0}, okay?"
"17391390","Listen to me, Titamon. You were defeated once by
{0}."
"1a391869","But {0} revived you, too."
"193916f6","It was my fault that you and {0} fought,
and for that I'm sorry."
"1c391b4f","I'm asking you, please don't drag this world into chaos."
"1b3919dc","...?!"
"1e391e95","You have got to be kidding me."
"1d391d22","It's all nonsense! There's no way that this human could have
defeated the mighty Titamon."
"203921fb","Something doesn't quite add up here. My Zanjinto tells me
so..."
"1f392008","Try to remember, Titamon!
Your sword, it remembers that battle!
Have you forgotten that fearsome battle at Server Tower!?"
"a631a5c8","This is NOT good..."
"a731a7bb","Hey, you! Stop flapping your gums!"
"a831a92e","You low-lifes... Looks like I was being used."
"a931aa81","If I ever see either of you again, you'll be sorry!"
"aa31ac74","Eeek!"
"ab31ade7","Titamon!"
"ac31af5a","I remember some things...about Shoma and the Three Gods of
Ruin..."
"ad31b0cd","The AR Plan ended in failure, didn't it?"
"9e319950","The world of the gods crumbling and Hell rising...
Heh. That could've been interesting."
"9f319ac3","I wasn't myself then. No plans like that will ever become
reality."
"ac33ee31","So it seems. I followed you once, but I see no value in
doing so now."
"ab33ec5e","{0}...my Zanjinto is responding to you, but do
you have what it takes to convince me?"
"aa33eaeb","You need to do two things to prove yourself to me."
"a933e978","One. Bring me a sinister Digivolution Core, so I can return
to full power."
"b033f47d","Two. Once you've done that, we will fight. If you win, you
will prove yourself worthy."
"af33f28a","Looks like we'll need more than just words to bring it
around, but we're getting there. Let's do as it says."
"ae33f117","First we need to get a Digivolution Core..."
"ad33efa4","And it has to be sinister...so that a Digimon can Digivolve
into a Dark type...I guess?"
"a433e159","There's a message from Mirei... It's about the next
Digimon's location."
"a333dfe6","Noir and I will go ahead and check out some of the more
suspect places."
"aa40b6fe","Sorry, {0}, but I'm going to have to leave
this to you."
"2d174a2a","Bring me a sinister Digivolution Core."
"2c1748b7","Select a Digivolution item to give."
"2b1746c4","You do not have any Digivolution items."
"2a174551","This isn't what Titamon is after."
"83c5604e","You got it? Good."
"82c55edb","Hmph!"
"81c55d68","Ha! With this I'm back to my former self--no, I'm even
stronger!"
"88c5686d","Only the strongest can prove themselves. That is how it is
for those Digimon who are survivors."
"87c566fa","Enough talking! Prove yourself!"
"73c58f31","You want to try again? If you insist. Bring it on!"
"2c52083b","Wonderful."
"2d5209ae","You did exactly what I asked, no questions."
"2e520b01","If you'd wanted, you could have just fought me from the
start."
"2f520cf4","Human, you are worthy. You are a true warrior, and you
deserve my trust."
"30520e67","What do you w--no, I already know. I will head to Floatia.
Do you have a place where something as big as me can stay?"
"31520fda","If not, I'll have to squeeze in somewhere. You might need to
arrange some ventilation though! Haha!"
"3252114d","Titamon joined the city!"
"e7b70aa4","This is the last place we have left to search...
which means..."
"eab70f7d","Whoooa! Who are you guys?!"
"e9b70d8a","Finally!"
"e4b705eb","As you can see, I'm living my life legit--just a
good-natured Digimon!"
"e3b70478","You've got no business being here, so off you go! Go on!"
"e6b70931","Hold on. Just hear us out..."
"e5b7075e","We don't care about what happened before. In fact, it's me
who should apologize."
"e0b6ffbf","You kidding me? Hmph. Being all apologetic... You used to be
so much cooler. Bummer."
"dfb6fdcc","Oh, you really think so...?"
"e2b4c42e","That wasn't a compliment, {0}. You do the
talking. You're far better suited to this."
"e3b4c581","How about coming to the city?
How about grabbing some food in the city?
I've got the perfect place for you in the city."
"e0b4c0c8","I'm not really cut out for the hustle and bustle of city
life."
"e1b4c2bb","What kind of Digimon do you think I am?!"
"e6b4ca5a","You've got to work to put food on the table.
You can unwind once work's finished.
Some Digimon enjoy the freedom."
"e7b4cbcd","Seriously?"
"e4b4c774","Hmm... Nah, I'll pass."
"e5b4c8e7","Come on! Just give it a try!
You could come just to help out in emergencies.
Fine. I give up."
"dab4b7b6","Heh. That doesn't sound too bad, actually..."
"dbb4b929","No way! Not a chance!"
"dcb27c25","Hmm... If you gave me a decent allowance, and threw in some
snacks too, I'd think about it."
"dbb27ab2","Don't push it, or we might just wait for your Reincarnation,
which wouldn't take long, if you catch my drift."
"dab278df","Eek! Okay, okay! I was only kidding!"
"dab278da","Hmm...I'd rather not have to do any work... Can't you
arrange that?"
"dab278d9","If you could, I could imagine myself going to the city. Oh,
I don't wanna live by a market or anything. Somewhere fun!"
"dab278d8","That possible? I'd be there in a flash if you could sort
that out..."
"d9b2776c","Oh yeah...I heard that there's an arena in Floatia."
"d8b275f9","With me, you could earn a living gambling there.
I guarantee it."
"d7b27406","Just bring me 5,000--no, 10,000 <icon>LUCK</icon>.
Sounds like too good an opportunity to miss, right?"
"d6b27293","Well, okay...I guess..."
"d5b27120","So, it looks like we have a deal."
"e4b2889d","It's a message...from Mirei...? What?!"
"e3b2872a","This is bad... Sorry, but this needs to be dealt with right
away."
"56af6abc","Sorry about this. We'll leave this up to you."
"57af6c2f","Hmph. I get the feeling that Samudramon or Kuzuhamon have
been up to something."
"58af6d82","Ah well, nothing to do with me. Anyway, get me those
10,000 <icon>LUCK</icon>, okay?"
"58af6d87","Ah well, nothing to do with me. Anyway, get me those
10,000 <icon>LUCK</icon>, okay? And the arena!"
"8533edd1","WHOA! You actually managed to do it?! Sweet!"
"8233e918","I know we had some beef before, but I'm willing to forget
all that now."
"8333ea8b","I'll be a billionaire! The ultimate gambler! You are
witnessing the birth of a legend!"
"8833f2aa","Once I'm a success, I won't need to worry about the Three
Gods of Ruin! I can't wait to see the look on their faces!"
"8933f41d","You do your best too, y'hear? See you at the arena."
"8633ef44","You're back! Show me the money... {20} <icon>LUCK</icon>..."
"8733f137","That's not enough! I said 10,000 <icon>LUCK</icon>! Jeez!"
"8733f132","What? Get that arena built ASAP!"
"7c33df86","MetalEtemon joined the city!"
"1e569f92","Hmph. So you came? Any longer, and these guys would've been
goners."
"1d569e3f","{0}... Good to see you."
"1c569c4c","Okay, fight me!"
"1b569ad9","Noir and I have fought Samudramon a few times. It's got a
new power..."
"1a569966","As it fights, it learns its opponents moves. Looks like its
Reincarnation had a strange side effect."
"195697f3","You're correct. I have longed for this strength! I am the
mightiest of all!"
"18569600","I have already taken all your power. A Digimon like Omegamon
Alter-B is a mere fleck of dirt on the floor to me now!"
"2756adfd","While I admit you're power is impressive, Samudramon, you
should know, I've found your weakness."
"2656ac0a","What do you mean?"
"1954591c","Allow me to prove it with {0}. Do you remember
our original deal?"
"1a545a8f","Yeah. If you beat me, I will obey you."
"1b545c62","Trust me, {0}, okay? Just do as I tell you."
"1c545dd5","Hold out for 30 seconds without striking, or using either
Orders or Items."
"155452d0","I'll seal its MP. It's not gonna be easy... I'm counting on
you!"
"e6bfed95","You came! You've gotta help! I can't hold out much longer!"
"e3bfe8dc","The more you fight me, the more powerful I become! I will
absorb all your power!"
"a0b3ad81","Got it! You can stop now! Good work!"
"9db3a8c8","What? Why won't you attack?! Is something wrong with you?!"
"9eb3aabb","With us? Heh. You should ask yourself the same question.
Don't you feel a little strange?"
"a3b3b25a","Hrnn?! What's going on?! I can feel my power draining..."
"a4b3b3cd","Now give it all you've got, {0}."
"f1946fc4","Nng! I didn't think it'd unleash ExE..."
"f494749d","This is no good. Start over..."
"23b1ce1f","Argh! Why?! What's happening to my new power...?!"
"24b1cff2","Just as I expected. You haven't mastered your powers yet."
"24b1cff0","I noticed that in order to absorb your opponent's ability,
you mentally detach at the start of the fight and go wild."
"24b1cff6","So I thought, what if your opponent did nothing at the start
of the fight?"
"24b1cff4","Your ability to absorb would act negatively, leaving you
with less power than when you started."
"25b1d165","So when faced with two Digimon, you couldn't even rely on
your former strength."
"1eb1c660","My...strength... Unf! What's happening?!"
"1fb1c7d3","You're facing the consequences of utilizing power you never
earned."
"20b1c946","We've been there before ourselves..."
"21b1cb39","It's up to you now, {0}."
"2ab1d904","So are you going to join the city?
You've no choice but to join the city.
You should give the city a try."
"2bb1daf7","Well, we did make a deal... Actually, no, there's another
reason..."
"28b41495","I've realized that you're an opponent I need to defeat."
"27b41322","If I'm in the city, I can challenge you any time. Sounds
good to me."
"26b4114f","Samudramon joined the city!"
"b9650ec8","Why, hello there. As you can see, Taomon..."
"bc651381","...has disappeared. I'm not sure when it happened."
"bb65122e","I know where he's heading, though. To Logic Volcano, where
Kuzuhamon is."
"be6516e7","Do Taomon and Kuzuhamon have some sort of connection?"
"bd651574","They both trained under the same master, Sakuyamon."
"c06519cd","From time to time, Sakuyamon enters into a deep sleep, in
order to preserve its strength for fighting against evil."
"bf65185a","I hear that one time, while Sakuyamon was asleep, Taomon and
Kuzuhamon traveled the world, undergoing intense training."
"b26503c3","After they had gone their separate ways, I first met Taomon."
"b1650250","What happened between those two is a mystery to me. In the
end, Taomon and I parted on bad terms, too!"
"b462c8b2","Though things have gotten better between us, that stubborn
fool and I still butt heads."
"b562ca25","It's possible Taomon and Kuzuhamon have met and are catching
up."
"b262c56c","However, I don't know whether anything happened to either
Titamon or Samudramon after their Reincarnation."
"b362c6df","Would you mind checking up on both of them
for me, {0}?"
"b062c206","I'll contact Shoma. If something happens while you're out
there, meet up with him."
"5687c735","You..."
"5387c27c","The mercy of my enemies has brought me back to life as this
worthless creature. What could you want with me?"
"5487c3ef","..."
"5187bf16","You cannot seriously be inviting me to go to Floatia."
"5287c089","Don't make me laugh. Taomon wouldn't joke like that."
"4f87bc30","Sorry I'm late, {0}!"
"5087bda3","Shoma..."
"5d87d23a","As you can see, Kuzuhamon, I've come to my senses. That's
why I'm here with {0}."
"5e87d3ad","What are you going to do? Stay here forever?"
"db8ad6cb","I'm bored with you now. Leave."
"da8ad558","You're just going to sulk? You're incredibly powerful. I'm
sure Taomon would be pleased to see you in the city."
"dd8ada11","...!"
"dc8ad8be","I told you to leave."
"df8add77","Ah!"
"de8adb84","Next time, I won't miss."
"e18ae05d","It's getting stronger!"
"e08adeea","Kuzuhamon wavered when we mentioned Taomon...
Where has Taomon gone?"
"d38aca53","You haven't changed one bit."
"d28ac8e0","That all you have to say after all this time? You haven't
changed either, Taomon."
"49833550","Actually, I have. Here. Take a look at this."
"4a8336c3","Is that...a fox lily?!"
"4b8338b6","When the world returned to normal, I started growing it in
secret. I was delayed getting here because I went to get it."
"4c833a29","That's right. It grew from the seed you gave me."
"4d833b9c","..."
"4e833d0f","While we were training together, I couldn't hold a candle to
you."
"4f833ee2","One day, when I was at the end of my tether with my dark and
light arts training, you gave it to me."
"50834055","At that time, I had no idea what it meant, so I never tried
planting it or growing it."
"518341c8","Later on I realized that this seed is very delicate. To
cultivate it, you need to have mastered dark and light."
"528343bb","You could be strict, but you were kind enough to do that for
me. So how could you do something so heinous?"
"4f857d59","Hmph. If you really want to know..."
"4e857be6","What?!"
"4d857a73","Urk...You wanted this power...?"
"4c857880","Looks like you managed to defend yourself. Fine. I'll fight
you just like the good old days."
"53858385","Taomon's defense is phenomenal as usual."
"52858212","Even so, this is bad... Gah! What should we do?!"
"518580bf","Hm. You've improved, but it's still not enough."
"50857ecc","Unf... I don't need any help..."
"57858a31","No way can we just stand by and watch!"
"5685885e","Shoma, Noir...thank you..."
"4d924606","...!"
"4e9247f9","We're on your side, Taomon.
Isn't that right, {0}?"
"9ac59d32","You... No... This is how it should be!"
"99c59b5f","Hah! We're going to show you just how resilient we are!"
"8098afeb","Ack..."
"8198b15e","Kuzuhamon...!"
"8298b331","Looks like you made some good friends..."
"8398b4a4","I'll tell you why I broke the rules that day, and why I
worked towards Ultimate Digivolution..."
"8498b617","Taomon...I was jealous of you."
"8598b78a","I know I started training before you and it looked like I
could do anything,"
"8698b97d","but you were a natural compared to me. You understood the
value of light and dark on a pure level..."
"7798a180","Our master said the same thing about you."
"7898a373","...!"
"859af661","I never realized... Our master must have said those things
to inspire me to fight harder."
"849af48e","I'd never been good at controlling light and dark... I...
Once our master went to sleep,"
"839af31b","and overwhelmed by jealousy, rage, and greed, I did
something I shouldn't have..."
"829af1a8","Pathetic, right? I tried to bring the world into chaos."
"899afcad","..."
"889afb3a","I should never have been reborn... No, actually, I'm glad I
was, because now I can tell you everything."
"879af947","..."
"869af7d4","How about coming to the city?
There's a nice place you can go. It's called Floatia.
Come live with Taomon in Floatia."
"7d9ae989","Heh heh... This human never changes. Always so genuine,
leading with the heart..."
"7c9ae816","Taomon, were we ever like that...?"
"b9e07ea","Kuzuhamon...!"
"c9e095d","So, you see now, right?"
"99e0484","Yeah. Just give me a little time..."
"a9e0677","Well, we've done all we can for now. Let's head back."
"4bbfd93e","Good to see you again."
"4abfd74b","That was a long walk you went out for, Taomon."
"49bfd5d8","Hmph. Unlike some old folk around here, my legs still work
fine."
"50bfe0dd","Heh-heh, is that all you have to say for yourself?"
"4fbfdf6a","..."
"4ebfddf7","Huh?! Kuzuhamon?!"
"4dbfdc04","Oh, welcome!"
"44bfce39","Did you design this place, Taomon?"
"43bfcc46","Um...yeah..."
"c6bcc928","I like it much better than the old place."
"c7bcca9b","Kuzuhamon, are you going to live here in Floatia? That would
be nice."
"c8bccc0e","It looks like I am."
"c9bccde1","Ummm, my name's Himari...but you already know everything
about us, right?"
"cabccf54","Mostly. Sorry, I'm not good at speaking to people, so I'll
leave my greetings at that."
"cbbcd0c7","Not sure I could call those greetings..."
"ccbcd2ba","You're just like Taomon!"
"cdbcd42d","Nah. I'm a tiny bit better."
"bebcbcb0","Perhaps you are--now at least."
"bfbcbe23","Anyway, I want to thank you for your help, {0}."
"38c43863","Everything went exactly as I thought it would. Thank you,
{0}, and you too, Tsuzuki."
"37c436f0","I never thought MetalEtemon of the Three Gods of Ruin would
ever join Floatia! How wonderful!"
"3ac43b49","I always dreamed of seeing Floatia prosper."
"39c439d6","Digimon and humans, formidable opponents, and even the
Enforcer, all working together..."
"3cc43eaf","I could die without a single regret now!"
"3bc43d3c","Heh, no way you're going to be kicking the bucket any time
soon!"
"3ec441f5","Hahaha! Indeed! Floatia and me forever!"
"3dc44002","Hah..."
"40c444db","I can't believe I've started to enjoy this kind of
interaction. Kuzuhamon, I hope you remember who you were."
"3fc44368","You cleared the Add-On Scenario
""Revival: Three Gods of Ruin and...""!"
"11dc04d7","And how are you? Titamon is in Absolute Zero. As soon as
we know the other locations, we'll let you know."
"11dc04d6","I had a hunch, but still...MetalEtemon? Maybe we should set
up a trap?"
"11dc04d5","It will be difficult to reason with Samudramon..."
"11dc04d4","It feels strange not having Taomon around after all this
time. My nerves are somewhat on edge..."
"11dc04d2","Head to Logic Volcano ASAP and bring back Kuzuhamon!"
"11dc04d3","If the Three Gods of Ruin come to the city, then all will be
well! Still, I've got a bad feeling for some reason..."
"12dc064a","...Hm? Oh, I'm fine. I was just thinking about something..."
"12dc064b","MetalEtemon has come back to life too... So, going by the
order in which everything has happened..."
"12dc0648","Samudramon appeared in Faulty Ex Machina...which means..."
"12dc0649","I am very grateful for all you've done. Thank you."
"12dc064e","Please look in on Kuzuhamon from time to time. I'm sure
you're up to the task."
"13dc083d","You appeared just at the right time again."
"13dc083c","I wouldn't exactly say I'm living in luxury here, but with
no opportunity to fight, I can feel myself getting rusty."
"13dc083f","I thought MetalEtemon would revive. I wish Reincarnation
improved the Digimon's personality too!"
"13dc083e","It's difficult to imagine a mature, diligent MetalEtemon..."
"13dc0839","Yukimura and I'll head out too!"
"13dc0838","We can't, Kouta. We have to protect our fortress--I mean,
the city."
"13dc083b","Come to think of it, Taomon's sneaked out before, right?"
"13dc083a","Hmm, I knew he liked to check on the city sometimes, but
I didn't know it went beyond that. Trust you to know, Kouta."
"13dc0835","I hope Kuzuhamon and the others can learn to feel at home
here."
"13dc0834","It would be surreal to have dinner with the Three Gods of
Ruin."
"cdbfd38","Everything will be fine. It always works out."
"cdbfd39","It's possible the city will be attacked, but we'll handle
anything that's thrown at us."
"cdbfd3a","I remember how desperate I felt when Server Tower went down."
"cdbfd3b","Maybe it should be fixed?"
"cdbfd3c","The last two are tough customers, but with Shoma on our side
we should be able to deal with them."
"cdbfd3d","I like a good fight from time to time, but I'm not sure I'd
want to come up against those two."
"cdbfd3e","Just Kuzuhamon to go. I wonder what happened between him and
Taomon. I wanna know!"
"cdbfd3f","Yeah, it intrigues me too, to be honest! Hee hee!"
"cdbfd30","Sorry we have to rely on you yet again. I wish I could help
more, so I could brag about it to everyone..."
"cdbfd31","You brag enough already..."
"ddbfeab","Shoma should give the orders! That's okay, right...?"
"ddbfeaa","I knew Kuzuhamon wouldn't stay gone long! I wonder whether
he'll come to the city or not."
"ddbfea9","MetalEtemon gave me a Luck Coin! Does that mean it's getting
a bit nicer?!"
"ddbfea8","Taomon's missing! Find out what you can, quickly!"
"ddbfeaf","You're the best, {0}! Great work!"
"edc001e","So, we're going after Titamon first. It's not going to be an
easy fight, but it'll be great to have him in the city."
"edc001f","Titamon and Ogremon are part of the demon Digimon elite.
I've had a few run-ins with them in the past."
"edc001c","It looks like Tsuzuki's having a tough time. It's up to you
to help him out."
"edc001d","You work really well with others. You really are an
excellent student!"
"edc001a","Taomon and Kuzuhamon were like siblings. As an only child, I
always wanted an older brother."
"edc001b","By the way, you should speak to Titamon. He's got some
interesting tricks up his sleeve."
"edc0018","If you have time, you should go see Titamon."
"edc0019","I wouldn't expect anything less from you. Let's do this
again when you're free."
"fdc01f1","Why can't we ever find anything straight away...? Sorry. I'm
just a little frustrated."
"fdc01f0","Awakening new abilities through Reincarnation, huh? That's
got my curiosity piqued."
"fdc01f3","We still have to deal with them. Things could get real bad
if we get on their bad side."
"fdc01f2","Samudramon's in another dimension. He and Mastemon don't
really see eye to eye..."
"fdc01f5","Kuzuhamon reminds me of someone I know, although I reckon
their personalities differ."
"8dbf68c","I had a feeling something bad would happen, and it has..."
"9dbf87f","Let's speak at Jijimon's house. We have to deal with this
ASAP."
"16de4b6d","Is it just me or does ""Three Gods of Ruin"" sound like a
heavy metal band?!"
"15de49fa","I have no idea what goes on in your head sometimes..."
"8803c1b6","Hey!"
"8703bfc3","?!"
"8603be50","So far so good. All that's left to do is fight..."
"8d03c955","Sorry, I guess I should explain what's going on first.
I have info on Titamon's new ability."
"8c03c7e2","He's able to summon Tamers from a different dimension,"
"8b03c60f","and call forth two partners from the past or the future."
"8a03c49c","Heeey!"
"9103cf81","(' ')"
"9003ce2e","!"
"83017b20","This may sound like a cop-out, but I want to be in top shape
when I fight you."
"84017c93","I'm getting antsy. Right! Let's go, partner!"
"940851a8","DO NOT TRANSLATE"
"97085661","DO NOT TRANSLATE"
"9608548e","DO NOT TRANSLATE"
"95956983","Okay... You win."
"96956b76","I've got zero excuses right now. I guess you've just got to
find some things out for yourself."
"97956ce9","I have a new goal now: I'm going to learn how to raise two
partners."
"98956e5c","When I do, be prepared to fight me again. Does that sound
good?"
"99956fcf","All right. This was fun!"
"9997aea6","Hmm? You want to fight again? Fine by me."
"9897ad33","It'll be nice to know whether the last battle was a fluke,
right? Don't hold back, okay?!"
"f3453621","Hey, {0}."
"f0453168","Titamon created this space. It's a dimension where only
chosen Tamers can fight extreme battles."
"f14532db","You can call forth two partners from the past or the future."
"f6453afa","Titamon found the perfect opponent for you."
"f7453c6d","This is like a dream come true for me. Show me what you've
got!"
"c97c23b4","Even with all that force coming at you, you still emerged
victorious."
"cc7c280d","But, let me say this... One day--make no mistake--I will
defeat you. Then my dream will really have come true."
"cb7c269a","Heh, that was fun!"
"69bcb827","Good to see you, {0}. You have arrived in the
middle of quite a commotion."
"69bcb826","It looks like all the public toilets in the Digital World
have been taken over by a band of Sukamon!"
"69bcb825","The toilets in Floatia seems fine, but nine other places
have been affected!"
"69bcb824","I don't know why they would do such a thing, but it's most
alarming."
"69bcb823","We went and checked the places out."
"69bcb822","The Sukamon have really jammed themselves inside, and don't
plan on coming out any time soon."
"69bcb821","I was thinking of smacking them out of there..."
"69bcb820","If you did that, the toilets would be wrecked. You're all
brawn and no brains sometimes."
"69bcb82f","Things are going to get worse unless they come out soon."
"69bcb82e","Kouta and I are working to get portable toilets delivered
to all the affected areas."
"6abcb99a","It's still not enough, though. We're running short on them
fast."
"6abcb99b","We haven't been able to get any to the west of the Ohguino

"6abcb999","We're counting on you, {0}."
"6abcb99e","No problem!
...Wait. Counting on me to do what?!"
"6abcb99f","DO NOT TRANSLATE"
"6abcb99c","I knew we could rely on you!"
"6abcb99d","It's up to you to deal with the Sukamons!"
"6abcb992","Oops! Didn't I say?! Help us out with the toilet situation!"
"6abcb993","You really are a Savior, {0}!
Isn't that right, Himari?"
"6bbcbb0d","Ahaha! Indeed you are, {0}!"
"6bbcbb0c","I'm sorry we can't help, but we've got our hands full."
"6bbcbb0f","Are some Numemon playing tricks? I'll go talk to them!"
"6bbcbb0e","Luche, we were in the middle of praising
{0}'s efforts... Don't butt in..."
"6bbcbb09","Hmm... Actually..."
"6bbcbb08","It might be a good idea to talk to Sukamon and Numemon in
the city. They may have some ideas about what to do."
"6bbcbb0b","Talk to Numemon, Sukamon, and PlatinumNumemon in the city.
Thanks, {0}."
"6bbcbb0a","Phew! That's a load off my mind!"
"6dbefcca","Hello, {0}.
How's the toilet thing coming along?"
"6dbefccb","Sorry to put this on you, but I do appreciate the help."
"6dbefcc8","So how's it going? Sorry, I can't help out."
"6dbefcc9","If Kouta was here, he'd lend a hand, but he's still not back
from distributing the portable toilets."
"6dbefcce","I'm crazy busy, too. Anyway, I'm sure you've got this!
Hee hee!"
"6dbefccf","I'm sorry you have to deal with this by yourself,
{0}."
"6dbefccc","Of all the times for this to happen... Something strange is
going on..."
"6dbefccd","Hi, {0}! What's up? I wanted to help with the
Numemon too, y'know!"
"6dbefcc2","What?! You've seen a good-looking Numemon?! I wanna see it,
too!"
"6dbefcc3","I can't believe I have to lug toilets around...
It's best to try and stay positive though, I guess..."
"6cbefb57","If the Sukamon are working as a group, maybe KingSukamon's
responsible? I don't have any idea how those guys think."
"6cbefb56","I'm sooo not interested in this case. Is it because it
grosses me out or because it's too much of a pain?"
"6cbefb55","Has something happened? Let me know when you're done and
I'll come and claim all the rewards!"
"6cbefb54","Rina! As a member of the Royal Knights, you cannot be
serious! Don't say such things!"
"6cbefb53","Sorry, but I'm still not back to full power. This one's all
yours, {0}."
"6cbefb52","Who would have thought the Sukamon and Numemon would join
forces? Make sure you conduct a thorough investigation."
"bff2dc3a","I'm not in the mood for talking, but whatever..."
"bff2dc3b","I got sent a summons via DigiMail. Apparently the same mail
was sent to all Numemon, calling them to action."
"bff2dc38","Apparently an influential Sukamon general has also headed
out... This could turn into an all-out war..."
"bff2dc39","But that's not my bag, so I just ignored the mail. I like it
here."
"bef2da47","Wha-wha-what?! All the public toilets have been taken over?!"
"bef2da46","Yeah, I did get a DigiMail."
"bef2da45","But I love this ground so much I could just bury myself in
it..."
"bef2da44","I can't describe how good it feels! There's no way I could
ever leave it..."
"bef2da43","Hmm? What should you do about the toilet thing? Well, us
Sukamon can't resist Fossilized Poop."
"bef2da42","If you find some of that, you'll probably be able to lure
them out. It's not easy to get hold of though..."
"bdf2d8d4","I heard rumors that some Sukamon and Numemon have locked
themselves in public toilets... What?! It's true?!"
"bdf2d8d5","I got a DigiMail, but figured it was just a prank. Of
course, even if I thought it were serious, I wouldn't go."
"bdf2d8d6","I have a soft spot for shiny things. There's nothing I love
more than being surrounded by beautiful things here."
"bdf2d8d7","What can you do to solve the problem? Hmm... I believe
General Numelfos has been dispatched to the Vast Plateau."
"bdf2d8d0","Let him get a whiff of some Organic Vintage Digimoss and
he'll be like putty in your hands. That'll get him out."
"bdf2d8d1","Organic Vintage Digimoss is being grown in the small room
next to the Captain's Cabin on the MOD Ship."
"bdf2d8d2","I'll send a DigiMail!"
"baf095a4","I dunno anything else... I just got that one DigiMail.
That's all."
"baf095a5","I'm gonna be in so much trouble for ignoring that
DigiMail... I don't dare to move from this spot..."
"782cfca5","Hmmm... If you like that kind of junk, I can find some more
for you. Come back when you feel like it..."
"7d41c1ca","Mmm... This place is perfect for me..."
"baf095a6","Umm... No, I can't think of anything else that'll help you."
"f5fb125c","Bloop-blup! It's me! Sukamon in the house!"
"f5fb125d","Jijimon said I could probably help out in the Agricultural
District."
"f5fb125e","But what should I do? I don't really know, but whatever,
right?!"
"f5fb125f","I'll make it up as I go along. Let's do this!"
"87b30217","Oh yeah! I've got something to tell you!"
"87b30216","That curse you got--<icon>呪い</icon>, right? I know how to
reduce its effects."
"87b30215","There's only one thing... It might affect your <icon>機嫌</icon>..."
"87b30214","So whaddya say? Interested?!"
"87b30213","Okay ({1}).
Okay ({2}).
No."
"baf095a7","What's up? Have you made progress? Did those idiots give up?"
"baf095a0","Please find a solution quickly. This is all just so
embarrassing... Give me shopping any day!"
"a3a81d67","Tee hee hee! Tata for now, {0}!"
"a3a81d66","I've got plenty of funds, so I want to contribute to the
town by shopping!"
"a3a81d65","This store is my favorite! I practically live here!"
"a3a81d64","If you know what it feels like to be rich, come see me! I'll
give you a token of my friendship."
"928ec7ec","Wow! This place is full of things I want! I'll take that and
that... I'll take all of it!"
"928ec7ed","You know... Not having money problems is a problem in
itself."

way to get in.)"

"fbc03399","That divine smell... What?! I thought you were an ally!"
"fbc03398","Even with the Enforcer out of the picture, I knew you, the
world's Savior, would not be so easy to deal with."
"fbc0339b","I am Numelfos the Light-Speed, ruler of the Nigh Plains!"
"fbc0339a","Um, so why are you doing this?
Can you just stop with the toilet nonsense?"
"fbc0339d",""
"fbc0339c","To fulfill my dream of uniting the Numemon and the Sukamon!"
"fbc0339f","And so everyone can poop outside!"
"fbc0339e","For the sake of the union between Numemon and Sukamon, I
cannot comply."
"fbc03391","There are two things you can do: Either leave, or go poop
outside!"
"fbc03390","(Poop outside? Am I seriously being asked to go to the
toilet in the street?!)"
"f8c02ec0","I am a noble warrior; I do not rest until I have fulfilled
my duty."
"f8c02ec1","There is nothing else for me to say: These toilets are mine!
I am Numelfos the Light-Speed! You cannot catch lightning!"
"ffc039c5","Well done, Savior of the world..."
"ffc039c4","In the Server Desert you'll find Moraigel. Though you have
defeated me, Moraigel will not be so easy."

message: The secret to the crown is with the princess."

the Realm of Outdoor Poop?)"

"ef6bbfcd","Egad! 'Tis you! The one who saved the world!"
"ef6bbfce","For someone who smells of Organic Vintage Digimoss to come
here... It can only mean one thing. Numelfos has fallen..."
"ef6bbfcf","Now you have defeated Numelfos, I suppose you intend to
challenge me?"
"ef6bbfc8","Meaning you are against doing your business outside..."
"f26bc485","I do not loathe you. In fact, I have the greatest respect
for you."
"ef6bbfc9","However, I am a warrior, and you understand that I must do
what I can for the sake of the Realm of Outdoor Poop."
"ef6bbfca","I just came to talk.
Sorry, but, um, what...?"
"ef6bbfcb",""
"ef6bbfc4","There is nothing left to say! I, Moraigel, am overflowing
with rage!"

indomitable fighting spirit..."
"eb6bb981","In the depth of Logic Volcano you will find the Flame Lands,
which holds something even I know not about."
"eb6bb982","The Sukamon leader, Puplang, guards something there, I hear.
Possibly a fossil."
"eb6bb983","All that the defeated have left to do is fade... Long live
the Realm of Outdoor Poop!"

"adee1221","I heard that Numelfos and Moraigel had retreated. Now I know
why..."
"adee1220","I thought you were a mere Fossilized-Poop thief, but I see
you were instead using it to trick me!"
"adee1227","Have at you! I shall beat the poop out of you! Hrrnnngaagh!"
"adee1226","Such a rush! I have not felt like this since I found a
rather glorious poop outside!"

bewitching..."
"da9c1757","What?! Do my eyes deceive me?! Are you the Savior?!"

Puplang has fallen..."

What's ""the Slate of Prophecy""?"
"da9c1753",""
"da9c1750","I shall tell you all I know...if you can beat me, that is!"
"de9c1d82","Hmmm... This fight was written on the Slate of Prophecy..."
"de9c1d83","...which was found in the Drainage Path."
"de9c1d80","It was foolish to fight a war for the sake of a slate not
soiled by poop..."
"de9c1d81","But it was impossible to resist its pull, like the tickly
feeling one gets before emptying one's bowels."
"de9c1d86","I cannot put a stop to its power..."

Savior, d'ya really think ya can defeat 'em?"

princess?!"

only I had known sooner..."
"c5b506cc","If the Secret Phrase and the Slate of Prophecy were
different, things would not have come to this."
"c5b506cd","Still, it appears that all this is tied to fate. Things are
too far gone to stop them now."
"c5b506ce","I do not wish to harm you, but as a follower of the king, I
fear I must. And I shall not hold back!"
"c5b506cf","Egad! What?!"
"c5b506c0","I 'eard you sayin' bad things about me. This poison will
stop ya from spoutin' such things again, Skaffelt!"

Too-da-loo!"
"c8b50b81","Damn you, Corellus, you pitiful snake..."
"c8b50b80","Poison?! Are you okay...?
Is there some kind of antidote?"
"c8b50b83","This is nothing... I can handle it..."
"c8b50b82","I am a warrior to the last and as such cannot flee a battle!
I, Skaffelt the Thunderous, will not be deterred!"
"c9b50d74","I know why they call you Savior... My apologies, but it is
time for me to bow out..."
"c9b50d75","I must go after Corellus. Though I doubt the king would
listen to that swine, there may be others involved."
"c9b50d76","You will no doubt encounter Kaoriel soon enough... She is
the Princess of Numemon,"
"c9b50d77","and when you meet her, tell her I said to flee for the sake
of that which I entrusted to her."
"c9b50d70","Our code phrases: ""This is a most fortuitous coincidence!""
and ""Last night I dreamed we would meet again."""
"c9b50d71","My apologies, but you must do this for me."
"c9b50d72","Finally, if you tell Modorius of Bony Resort that you undid
Skaffelt, he will probably come out."
"c9b50d73","It is likely that he knows some things... Alas, he and I do
not get along...really..."
"c9b50d7c","Anyway, that is of little importance. I must be going now,
Savior! Fare thee well!"
"3001c61f","I defeated Skaffelt.
I have something to say about Skaffelt, your Modoriusness."
"3001c61e","Are you serious? My Skaffelt?! Does that mean that you are
the Savior?"
"3001c61d","I see... So where is my Skaffelt now?"
"3001c61c","(You passed on Skaffelt's message.)"
"3001c61b","Skaffelt is pursuing Corellus?! I refuse to believe that!
The Princess is the one being pursued!"
"3001c61a","Oh, my aching heart! I know Kaoriel is a PlatinumNumemon and
I am a Geremon..."
"3001c619","Of course we differ, but there is no purer love than the
love I feel for Skaffelt!"
"3001c618","Anyway, do you know about the Slate of Prophecy?
Skaffelt mentioned something about a prophecy..."
"3001c617","Oh my aching h--Prophecy, you say? Yes, it states that the
Sukamon and Numemon will all perish."
"3001c616","It was written on a slate found in the Drainage Path. ""Seek
the Realm of Outdoor Poop and thine lives shalt be spared."""
"3101c7f2","When it was found, it caused a huge stir above and below the
ground, resulting in the king ordering the invasion."
"3101c7f3","No way! So what about the crown's secret?
So, uh, do you know about the secret of the crown too?"
"3101c7f0","That was also written on the slate. ""In victory, the Sukamon
king must proffer his crown to the Platinum Glory."""
"3101c7f1","Apparently the same thing is written on the crown, though I
cannot read the writing."
"3101c7f6","I presume it means the right to the throne will be passed on
to a PlatinumSukamon."
"3101c7f7","But that has nothing to do with us Numemon. You need to be
a Sukamon to rise to the throne."
"3101c7f4","I think that is enough for now. With Skaffelt gone, you and
I can have some fun, Savior."
"2c01bfd3","That was most enjoyable, but I am done..."
"2c01bfd2","Kaoriel of Absolute Zero is our princess. She cannot be
defeated."
"2c01bfd1","Oh, by the way, you may have this, for I no longer need it."
"2c01bfd0","(You got the Stone Shard.)"
"2c01bfd7","The day before the slate was found, Corellus was moving
something around and tripped. Then I heard something break."
"2c01bfd6","That is when I found this. I was going to give it to
Skaffelt..."
"2c01bfd5","...but instead you can have it. I shall bid you adieu,
Savior. Long live Skaffelt!"

Last night I screamed at my feet again.
Last night I something something something..."
"2aa69791","Those are the secret phrases Skaffelt and I agreed on!"
"2aa69796","(You passed on Skaffelt's message.)"
"2aa69797","Oh my! I have indeed been entrusted with something very
important..."
"2aa69794","Skaffelt told you that?"

this place relinquished."

crown's secret without Corellus or Diarius catching on."
"29a6963f","...?"
"29a6963e","Oh, Diarius is a PlatinumSukamon who issues orders to
Corellus."
"29a6963d","He leads the Sukamon, and is a most treacherous fiend who
despises Skaffelt."
"29a6963c","Please be careful. Diarius is utilizing the king's army
elite,"
"29a6963b","and thus wields immeasurable power."
"29a6963a","Diarius is an arrogant fool, so if you call his name he
should make himself known."

"e1c285e1","The destruction of the Sukamon is all a baseless lie!"
"e1c285e6","Kaoriel can verify it! The truth shall be brought forth!"
"e1c285e7","Silence! You should know your place, Skaffelt!"
"e1c285e4","You are a Numemon of lower standing! Begone with your
terrible jokes!"
"e1c285e5","I shall not be silenced, Diarius! It was you who caused the
ruckus over the slate!"
"e1c285ea","It was all a nefarious plot, devised to steal the crown!"
"e1c285eb","This scum confessed everything!"
"e2c28755","Ack! Forgive me, Diarius!"
"e2c28754","Corellus?! You fool!"
"e2c28757","With the fake prophecy, you brought the Sukamon and Numemon
to the edge of chaos, opposing both Savior and Enforcer!"
"e2c28756","You pushed us to the brink of extinction, all so you could
take the crown for yourself!"
"e2c28751","Show some respect, Skaffelt! The words on Slate of Prophecy
are for the king and the king alone!"
"e2c28750","Corellus himself admitted that you, Diarius, had faked the
slate!"
"e2c28753","Hah! And what does that prove?! Nothing! You think you can
fell me with your weaselly words?!"
"e2c28752","Your actions are nothing more than treason! Exterminate this
monster! Exterminate him!"
"e2c2875d","(You gave the king the Stone Shard.)"
"e2c2875c","What is this fragment of stone supposed to mean? It looks
familiar..."
"dfc2829c","Where did you find this?!"
"dfc2829d","Aha! It fits the missing place in the slate perfectly!"
"dfc2829e","(You explain that Modorius found the piece the other day,
after Corellus had dropped the slate.)"
"dfc2829f","Your evil shall be punished! You dare to call yourself a
Sukamon?!"
"dfc28298","Have at you!"
"dfc28299","Damn you, Skaffelt!"
"dfc2829a","Now I can finally bring your evil reign of terror to an end!
This is for all my fallen comrades!"
"dfc2829b","Extreeeeeeme Poop Death!"
"dfc28294","Bwaaaaaaarrrg!"
"dfc28295","Skaffelt, you impress me! I did not know you could use that
move, too!"
"e0c2840f","...Wait! That must mean you are the Platinum Glory!"
"e0c2840e","I am afraid not, Sire."
"e0c2840d","The Platinum Glory was made up by Diarius in order to steal
the crown."
"e0c2840c","Are you absolutely sure?!"
"e0c2840b","I am. The inscription on the crown differs from the writing
on the Slate of Prophecy."
"e0c2840a","Diarius knew that the words on the crown had not been
deciphered,"
"e0c28409","and so he used that to his advantage."
"e0c28408","It turns out that Numelfos of the Vast Plateau is an
authority on ancient digital languages."
"e0c28407","When the war broke out, he solved the mystery of the crown's
words."
"e0c28406","However, as a Numemon, he was not able to inform you, Sire,
of their meaning."
"e5c28c2e","Why in the world not?!"
"e5c28c2f","Well, the, um, inscription was discovered to be...well...
not very flattering..."
"e5c28c2c","I care not! Tell me its meaning at once!"
"e5c28c2d","As you wish, Sire. Kaoriel, kindly read what Numelfos
entrusted to you..."
"e5c28c2a","Very well. Here we go..."
"e5c28c2b","""Slip, slop, sloop! Poopy poop poop!"
"e5c28c28","You are a poopy head! Poop poop poop!"""
"e5c28c29","What is the meaning of this?!"
"e5c28c26","Even if Numelfos had tried to tell you, he would either not
be believed, or Diarius would have silenced him."
"e5c28c27","Numelfos did not know of Diarius's evil intentions, and even
if this war were to destroy the entire species,"
"e6c28d81","as long as you were alive, Sire, the Sukamon and Numemon
would rise again."
"e6c28d80","He decided not to tell you, and instead prepared to die
fighting for you."
"e6c28d83","What a beautiful, rising stink of a Digimon!"
"e6c28d82","Your story has moved me, Skaffelt! Numelfos, you have
stirred my bowels with joy!"
"e6c28d85","Sire, Numelfos will be pleased to hear that."
"e6c28d84","The inscription on the crown is more than simple tomfoolery!
It is magical!"
"e6c28d87","Those words blessed my head when I ascended the throne!"
"e6c28d86","What?!"
"e6c28d89","Skaffelt, it appears you were telling the truth. You have
upturned Diarius's evil plot to overthrow me!"
"e6c28d88","I owe you an apology, Savior!"
"e3c4c7bf","As compensation for my behavior, allow me to assign a
Sukamon as your partner!"
"e3c4c7be","No, thanks.
I'll pass.
*Pbbbbbbt*"
"e3c4c7bd",""
"e3c4c7bc",""
"e3c4c7bb","Hmph! Such insolence! You are not fit for us Sukamon!"
"e3c4c7ba","Hmmm, it seems you are not quite used to our way of
speaking. You should have said ""I'll pass wind."""
"e3c4c7b9","What a wonderful response! I see you are well versed in the
ways of our tribe!"
"e3c4c7b8","Very well, tell the beardy old-timer that I hereby end the
acquisition of the public toilets!"
"e3c4c7b7","Savior, we are indebted to you, and I cannot apologize
enough for the inconvenience we've caused."
"e3c4c7b6","I shall see that this sort of thing does not happen again."
"e2c4c5cc","Please take 50 of our finest items as compensation!"
"e2c4c5cd","...!"
"e2c4c5ce","You got 50 Impudentines!"
"e2c4c5cf","Hm?! It seems you cannot carry them! You should be more
organized!"
"e2c4c5c8","So be it. I shall leave them here. Retrieve them when you
are able to."
"e2c4c5c9","This is where I must bow out, Savior! I hope our paths cross
again!"
"e2c4c5ca","Farewell!"
"e2c4c5cb","Thank you!"
"e2c4c5c4","It seems the Disturbing Universal Major Problem--or, as it
will be forever known, ""DUMP""--has finally come to an end."
"e2c4c5c5","{0}, your name shall go down in history as the
courageous one who ended the DUMP!"
"e5c4ca85","Hm? You are {0}? Ha! I almost forgot!"
"248bbf8a","Hey! So you're back, {0}?"
"248bbf8b","I see, I see..."
"248bbf88","It's unbelievable that members of the Sukamon were behind
everything. Well, all's well that ends well! Good work!"
"248bbf89","You did good, {0}. No matter what's thrown at
you, you deal with it like a pro."
"248bbf8e","Nice work! That was epic!"
"248bbf8f","Finally, I don't have to shift anymore portable toilets!"
"248bbf8c","What? While I was getting portable toilets to everyone, you
solved the problem?"
"248bbf8d","I wanted to play with the Numemon too! Not the gross
Sukamon, though!"
"248bbf82","Are they really so different?!"
"248bbf83","The world's toilets have all been freed, and everything is
back to normal. Great work!"
"238bbe17","(To be honest... you should probably take a bath...or at
least go stand by a window or something...)"
"40720cf7","You cleared the Add-On Scenario ""Struggle of the Fates!""!"
"43fdd5c2","Sorry, but there was something I needed to tell you."
"42fdd46f","There's a strange signal coming from one of the ships in MOD
Cape."
"41fdd2fc","I picked it up too. It's not something I've seen before."
"40fdd109","If Noir doesn't know what it is, that probably means it's a
Digimon from a different world or dimension..."
"3ffdcf96","That sounds likely. It only appeared for a short while, so
we weren't able to verify anything."
"3efdce23","A strange signal... Something must have happened at MOD
Cape, so it needs investigating."
"3dfdccb0","A Digimon from another world... Hasn't this happened to you
before, {0}?"
"4cfde42d","Oh yeah, you met that Mei-thingy, cat-like Digimon, or
whatever it is..."
"4bfde2ba","It's certainly possible there is a connection."
"3efb8f4c","In that case, it would be best if you go, {0}.
Nothing beats experience."
"3ffb913f","We'll prepare in case we pick up a signal elsewhere. I'm
really sorry we always have to rely on you, but thanks."
"eaa55e8f","Do I know you? Well, whatever."
"eba56062","What am I doing here? Um...I dunno."
"eca561d5","I'm confused, but I'm not sure what I'm confused about. Do
you know?"
"e5a556d0","I dunno why, but I feel kinda annoyed... Can you help me?"
"e6a55843","Maybe you need medicine?
Maybe you need a remedy disk?
Maybe you need an antivirus program?"
"e7a55a36","No, I'm not sick..."
"e8a55ba9","What's that? Sounds like it could work. You never know
unless you try...so let's try!"
"f1a569f4","You used an antivirus program on Agumon (Black)."
"f2a56b67","Oh! I feel loads better!"
"efa7a505","My memory's coming back to me... There was a Digimon..."
"eea7a392","I'd never seen it before. It was surrounded by a strange
aura."
"eda7a23f","When it passed through here, my head started feeling fuzzy."
"eca7a04c","You used the antivirus program on the remaining Digimon in
the area."
"eba79ed9","I remember everything!"
"eaa79d66","Yeah, it had this weird aura around it."
"e9a79bf3","The aura became stronger and stronger, and then the Digimon
disappeared."
"aeaa9b14","*gasp*"
"b1aa9fed","What...? How...How could...I not even...last ten seconds...!"
"b0aa9e7a","*huff*... *huff*... *huff*... Who...Who was that...?"
"abaa965b","!"
"aaaa94e8","Snap out of it!
Did it have a strange aura around it?
Hold on. I'll help you."
"adaa99a1","Who the heck are you...? Agh!"
"acaa97ce","?!"
"cbce1c81","Nnnnnng!"
"c8ce17c8","You used an antivirus program on WereGarurumon (Black)."
"c9ce19bb","...? *gulp*"
"cece215a","What am I doing? Who are you?"
"cfce22cd","Did you help me? Owww... It hurts to move..."
"ccce1e74","Nnnf... I remember now. A Digimon just appeared out of
nowhere..."
"cdce1fe7","As I was looking at it, my head started to feel fuzzy, so I
thought it was an enemy, and attacked..."
"c2ce0eb6","And that's how I ended up like this. I couldn't leave a mark
on it, even though it wasn't all that big..."
"c3ce1029","I wouldn't call it tiny, though. It was kinda fuzzy-
looking...and orange..."
"d0d06317","Oh, yeah, I remember! When it left, it mumbled something!"
"cfd061a4","Something like ""not...give...fang..."" I'm not sure."
"d2d0667d","Then this strange aura surrounded it, and it disappeared."
"d1d0648a","Sorry, but that's all I can remember, because I was defeated
so quickly..."
"ccd05ceb","Okay, I'm outta here. If you're gonna go after that Digimon,
watch your back."
"a98a6dfe","Ack...I can barely move..."
"a88a6c0b","Something's flowing into my head...?! No!
What's happening...?!"
"a78a6a98","What?! How can its power work on Yukimura...?!"
"ae8a759d","...Nnnngraaagggh!"
"ad8a742a","Oh! {0}!"
"ac8a72b7","You came just in the nick of-- Actually, scratch that. Stay
back!"
"ab8a70c4","...Hrrnnngraaagh!"
"a28a62f9","Rngh! No...you...don't...!"
"a18a6106","Himari, {0}, this isn't working. Time to change
our approach."
"24875de8","But...fine, Rikka! Just hold on a bit longer!"
"25875f5b","Hang in there, Yukimura!"
"268760ce","I'm trying!"
"278762a1","Will...not...forgive...White...Fang!"
"28876414","Phew... It's gone."
"29876587","Rikka, Yukimura, you're life savers..."
"2a87677a","It was too much for us to handle... Let's head back to
Jijimon's house."
"de6344ab","I see... This is worse than I expected."
"df63461e","This is probably connected to the Meicoomon you met."
"e06347f1","It was quite developed, but still very cat-like. Maybe it's
a Digivolved form."
"e1634964","We had that pretty much figured out."
"e2634ad7","According to my analysis, it's a Digimon from another
dimension that can negatively effect those around it."
"e3634c4a","That fits in with the information you got."
"e4634e3d","Yeah, {0}'s partner wasn't affected by that
negative aura."
"d5633640","Himari, Rikka, Kouta and Yukimura went in first."
"d6633833","They all ended up getting beaten pretty bad, huh?"
"e3658b21","Its negative energy got stronger with its Digivolution,
which we'd predicted, but it was more than we expected."
"e265894e","It looks as though antivirus programs have an effect against
the negative energy."
"e16587db","It may be from a different world, but it's still a Digimon,
so I'm not surprised the program has some sort of effect."
"e0658668","I'm just glad it has at least some effect, anyway."
"e765916d","Still, it looks doubtful that we could force Reincarnation,
or interfere with its programming."
"e6658ffa","You're right. We'd need to defeat it, after which it would
take some time to input a program."
"e5658e07","Even so, we'd only have time to apply the antivirus program
and create a field..."
"e4658c94","About that. I'd like to give something a try..."
"db657e49","?"
"da657cd6","Yukimura..."
"69689caa","Ah!"
"6a689e1d","What's that?!"
"67689944","We managed to get some particles from its body."
"68689b37","Despite the small amount, even I can feel the effects of the
negative energy!"
"6568967e","It's like concentrated darkness... This goes far beyond
anything I expected..."
"666897d1","Wow! Go, Kouta! When did you manage this?!"
"63689318","I couldn't get the conversation we had before we left out of
my head."
"6468948b","When Mirei was talking about how the negative energy might
not have an effect on humans or their partner Digimon,"
"61689032","Luche asked whether it was because of her, right?"
"626891a5","Are you telling me...?!"
"4f6ab273","Yeah, I remember saying we'd need to try a few things out.
I see now..."
"4e6ab080","I remember now... I said to Kouta if I went at the Digimon
full throttle, we might be able to take a chunk out of it."
"516ab559","Yukimura and I are totally in sync with each other! We're
connected on a deep level! Mentally, even!"
"506ab3e6","Okay, we get it. Taomon's in pain, so we'll get it to touch
Luche."
"536ab8bf","Leave it to me!"
"526ab6cc","What the...?!"
"556abb85","How is this possible?!"
"546aba12","Luche expels the negative energy...?"
"576abeeb","Now this is a surprise..."
"566abd78","Seriously?! Can I defeat that Digimon?!"
"556cfa7c","We don't know if Luche can completely suppress the negative
energy, but with an antivirus program she may have a chance."
"566cfbef","Right. Your turn, Tsuzuki."
"576cfd42","It's too dangerous for Luche to go straight in by herself,
so Noir and I will act as decoys..."
"586cff35","Then I'll hit it with the antivirus program!"
"516cf430","Finally, you're up again, {0}. While the
negative energy is being suppressed, you fight it."
"526cf5a3","Excellent! The next time it appears, we'll be ready!"
"536cf716","Huh?!"
"546cf889","It's back...and it's close... The Old Cableway in Nigh
Plains."
"5d6d06d4","!"
"5e6d0847","Let's do this!"
"106e6b30","Over to you, Luche."
"136e6f89","Yeah! Leave this to me! I'm gonna do my best and stuff!"
"126e6e16","That's the spirit."
"156e72ef","Okay. I'm gonna create a distraction..."
"146e717c","Wait! Is that...a Digivolved Meicoomon?!"
"176e7635","Nnnngraaagggh!"
"166e7442","What do you want with this world?! As the Enforcer, I will
make you answer!"
"196e791b","Should I go now...?"
"186e77a8","Gnf...?!"
"2b6c56da","Graaaaaaagggh!"
"2c6c584d","Keep at it, Luche!"
"296c53f4","Whoaaaaa!"
"2a6c5567","We've got it where we want it!"
"276c50ae","Your turn, {0}!"
"286c5201","!!!"
"4c315eb3","{0}'s ready! Do it again, Luche!"
"4d316026","Groooooaaar!"
"4e316199","!!!"
"2ddc5add","Groo...nnng!"
"2adc5604","Did we win?!"
"2bdc57f7","Where...? Who...?"
"28dc533e","Um... The White...Fang... Oh!"
"29dc5491","I see now... I'm back here..."
"26dc4fd8","I've caused problems for everyone again, haven't I?"
"27dc514b","I'm so sorry... How can I explain?"
"24dc4cf2","It all started the last time I came here..."
"25dc4e65","I was being followed, and I somehow ended up in a
different--I mean, this dimension."
"12de6f33","In the past, my power caused a big disturbance in my
world... apparently."
"11de6d40","I don't remember anything about it, but it's probably true.
After that, I was sought for evil purposes,"
"14de7219","by an organization called ""The White Fang."""
"13de70a6","The White Fang came after me, using a device to cross
dimensions and a field to block my powers."
"16de757f","I suffered from shock as a result of switching dimensions,
making me lose my memory and unable to control my powers."
"15de738c","You have all helped me a lot, but it's too late for me to go
back to my own world."
"18de7845","In order to let me escape, my human partner fell into a
trap, and is now in the organization's hands."
"17de76d2","I was heading to their base to save my partner."
"1ade7bab","Sounds like you've had it rough."
"19de7a38","Their base contained a trap for me, but I destroyed it."
"a0d6fff8","I was close to saving my partner, but the White Fang had
another trick up their sleeve."
"a1d7016b","Because I was unable to control my powers, they captured me,
and used that device to send me to another dimension."
"a2d702de","I used my partner's power to Digivolve, but I was still
unable to stop the device in time..."
"a3d704b1","That's how I ended up here."
"a4d70624","It's an extraordinary coincidence that I ended up back here
in the same place."
"a5d70797","Perhaps it's because subconsciously I needed your help, and
my powers brought me here."
"a6d7090a","..."
"a7d70afd","What's your plan now? Go back to your world and try the same
thing again?"
"98d6f300","Of course."
"99d6f4f3","I'll go with you! We can rescue your partner together!"
"a6d947e1","I appreciate the offer, but that's not possible."
"a5d9460e","My power allows only me and me alone to travel back to my
world."
"a4d9449b","It seems this dimension and mine are connected, but I don't
know for sure."
"a3d94328","The only thing that can send me back to where I belong is
the strong bond I share with my partner."
"aad94e2d","I see you all understand that bond."
"a9d94cba","It's time for me to go. I'll never forget you."
"a8d94ac7","Your partner's counting on you. Don't give up.
Hopefully, we'll see you again at some point."
"a7d94954","Farewell, otherworldly Digimon person!"
"9ed93b09","There's so much going on in so many different Digital
Worlds..."
"9dd93996","I hope...the Digivolved Meicoomon...and its partner...can be
happy...together again..."
"a4e610ae","We forgot to ask its name."
"a5e61201","We'll meet again, I'm sure. For now, Floatia's waiting for
us."
"5a7026a","{0}, Shoma, and Luche, you all did wonderfully."
"4a700f7","I did too, y'know..."
"3a6ff04","You shouldn't praise yourself!"
"2a6fd91","You made yourself another friend, so you don't need praise!"
"1a6fc3e","?"
"a6fa4b","Huh? Do we have a visitor?"
"ffa6f8d8","It's Meicoomon, of course!"
"fea6f765","Huh?!"
"fda6f5f2","Yo!"
"80a3f254","That was quick..."
"81a3f3c7","Tee hee hee."
"82a3f5ba","Has everything been sorted out already...?"
"83a3f72d","What's going on?"
"7ca3ec28","We...y'know...fought, and it went back to its dimension."
"7da3ed9b","Uh huh."
"7ea3ef0e","I'm a new me now."
"7fa3f0e1","...?"
"78a3e5fc","My powers have been mixed with Luche's."
"79a3e76f","I see... Wait. What...?"
"f2ab61af","I...I'm not sure what's going on either..."
"f1ab603c","Luche has lots of inexplicable things about her, and we now
have one more thing to add to the list."
"f4ab64f5","I guess this is what makes Digimon so fascinating."
"f3ab6302","I see, I see. So, all is well, then."
"eeab5b63","Do you even know what we're talking about, Jijimon...?
Anyway, what about the negative energy thing...?"
"edab59f0","I can't sense it anymore."
"f0ab5e49","So all is well, then."
"efab5cd6","You too, Taomon?!"
"faab6e07","Heh heh. Having all these tough fighters here creates such a
different vibe."
"f9ab6c94","It's all good."
"eca919a6","I'm here too!"
"eda91b19","Hmm... Is that really a good thing...?"
"eaa91640","Anyway..."
"eba91833","Let me show you around the city, Meicoomon. I think you'll
like it around here."
"f0a91fd2","You cleared the Add-On Scenario ""The Crimson Claw Strikes
Back""!"
"caab4e39","There can't be many who would chose to arrive at the MOD
Ship. These folk from other dimensions are so unpredictable!"
"caab4e38","Have you not managed to meet up with Meicoomon yet?"
"caab4e3b","Kouta and Himari went on ahead. They may have already dealt
with everything. You should go help."
"caab4e3a","Luche is the one in the spotlight now. This could be
interesting."
"caab4e3d","Meicoomon really seems to like the Dimensional District.
Why not head over and say hi?"
"c7ab4960","So this tiny Digimon is Meicoomon? I see it has yet to be
fully understood by those in this world."
"c7ab4961","Won't you head to where Himari and the others are?
Remember to be extra careful about unidentified foes."
"c7ab4962","Preparation is key. Trust in Luche."

anymore."

"c8ab4ad6","We have done all we can. All that's left to do is hope."
"c8ab4ad5","I hope everything turned out okay in the other dimension,
too..."
"c8ab4ad4","I hope that next time we meet, we'll both be smiling. Who
knows which world we'll be in?"
"cdab52f2","Promise me you'll bring lots and lots of cat-like Digimon to
the city! Promise meee!"

"cdab52f7","Sorry, but I used up all my energy in the last fight..."
"cdab52f4","Our Meicoomon's really cute, but I kinda wanna know what
happened to the one that went back to its own world."
"cdab52f5","If the bond between the Digimon and its human partner is
like mine is with Himari, then all will be fine."
"ceab5465","Bored, bored, bored..."
"ceab5464","Are Kouta and everyone okay?"
"ceab5467",""
"ceab5466","I was amaaazing, wasn't I?! Praise me! Shower me with gifts!"
"cbab4fac","I know about lots of Digital Worlds, but not the one
Meicoomon's from."
"cbab4fad","It's been a while since Kouta and Himari have had a chance
to shine. Go see them!"
"cbab4fae","Tsuzuki and Luche used to be partners just like you, so you
understand the bond."
"cbab4faf","In Meicoomon's world they probably only partner a single
human, too."
"cbab4fa8","All that's happened takes me back... Maybe they have
elementary schools too?"
"ccab511f","I like the sound of a cat-like Digimon..."
"ccab511e","Himari and the others are working on the data we received."
"ccab511d","The Old Cableway in the Nigh Plains. You've got to get there
before it moves again."
"ccab511c","With Meicoomon in the city, we can gather as much data as we
like. Maybe our analysis can tell us about the other world."
"d1ab593e","Noir picked up an as yet unidentified pattern... We still
need more information."
"d1ab593f","Mirei and I will be putting our all into analyzing the
signal. You should go out into the field, {0}."
"d1ab593c","What's happening with Kouta and the others?"

soon as you can, {0}."

sky... I bet its world doesn't have anything like this."
"d2ab5a91","Hey, {0}. Everyone's at Jijimon's house."
"d2ab5a90","I need everyone's help again... I'll explain when we're all
together."
"cfad944f","Meicoomon? Yeah, I know Meicoomon. The one with the eyes...
and the mouth...and, um..."
"cfad944e","*sigh*... Always losing people's trust..."
"4c2cf209","Oh, you're here, {0}.
I think that's about everyone."
"492cedb0","Well then, let's begin."
"4a2cef23","A letter arrived. The address was in this town."
"4f2cf6c2","It says, ""Please join us in a feast of friendship""...in
seven different languages."
"502cf8b5","Oooh! A party invitation? Yikes, though, that's one beat-up
letter..."
"4d2cf3fc","Mm, this letter's material data is very unstable. Would've
been a lot faster to just use DigiMail."
"4e2cf56f","So, basically..."
"532cfd0e","The sender hasn't written their name, but we might well
suppose that they are not of this world."
"542cfee1","We've got another extradimensional invader?"
"d130021f","Well, we don't know for sure it's an enemy, right? They do
talk about friendship."
"d03000ac","Come on, this has ""trap"" written all over it! Where does it
say to go?"
"d3300565","The coordinates point to the Pink Stone House in Bony
Resort."
"d23003f2","My old home. I don't recall renting it out as a party space."
"cd2ffbd3","Then we have no idea what to expect."
"cc2ffa60","Well, suppose it is a trap. What might they be after?"
"cf2fff39","We can only theorize, but it seems the enemy lacks a clear
understanding of our situation."
"ce2ffd46","Therefore, they must plan to simply wipe out every
attendee...or possibly capture them as hostages."
"d9300ef7","In either case, their likely goal is to divide the forces we
have united here."
"d8300d04","Makes sense. But isn't it possible they just want to be
friends?"
"5f2892c4","Well, I'd sure like to think so... But for now, what should
we do about this?"
"602894b7","{0}, Himari, and Kouta, would you go as
Floatia's delegation to the party?"
"6128962a","Some of the finest in our city. Even if this does turn out
to be a trap..."
"6228979d","{0} should be able to manage it.
Or in the worst case scenario, to escape and return here."
"5b288c98","And just in case they somehow do get caught, Mr. Mameo and I
will still be here."
"5c288e0b","Exactly."
"5d288ffe","Well...all right.
If {0}'s going, it shouldn't end up too bad."
"5e289151","Ahem... Himari? What are you grinning about?"
"5728866c","Hey, wait a moment! I'm going too."
"582887df","The place used to be my house. What's the problem? And there
might be a party...how exciting!"
"652adacd","Hmph. Well..."
"642ad95a","Oh ho ho ho, then I'm coming too!"
"632ad7e7","What? You?!"
"622ad674","The Pink Stone House has a special place in my heart. And
besides, every party needs a clown, right?"
"612ad481","Good grief. When did you even get here? But...all right."
"602ad32e","Hee hee. Between Piedmon and me, {0} won't lack
for protection, either."
"5f2ad1bb","Then that's nine in all: {0}'s team,
Himari, Rikka, Kouta, Yukimura, plus Myotismon and Piedmon."
"5e2acfc8","Best of luck, representatives of Floatia! Myotismon, hold
onto this invitation, would you?"
"5d2ace55","You've got it. Now, {0}, just come talk to me
whenever you're ready."
"5c2acce2","There's a Gate linked to my house from here, so we'll be
able to return instantly."
"cc7ed93c","Are you ready? Time to fly to the Pink Stone House."
"cf7eddf5","I'm all set!
Sorry, not yet."
"ce7edc02","Then let's go!"
"c97ed463","Aaahh!"
"c87ed2f0","Huh?"
"cb7ed749","We're outside the grounds?"
"ca7ed5d6","Seems like we got repelled!"
"d57ee707","We must've hit some kind of barrier."
"d47ee594","So we can't get inside? Hm. What about..."
"c77c92a6","Aha, maybe this is it."
"c87c9419","Myotismon took out the invitation."
"c57c8f40","The door to the Pink Stone House opened!"
"c67c9133","So you've managed to surpass my magic powers, have you? Not
bad, whoever you are."
"8917e5f","...?"
"9918032","Huh? The light's out?"
"a9181a5","Is it a surprise party or something?"
"39176a0","What are we supposed to do if we get attacked?"
"4917813","Hmm. I have the ability to see in the dark, but this...
This is no ordinary darkness."
"5917986","Looks that way. I can't see anything either!"
"6917b79","Can anyone make fire or a light or something?"
"f918944","Right! The Digivice! Hang on. Hmm... Man, it's dark...
Wait, that's weird. Where is it?"
"10918b37","..."
"d93c4d5","..."
"c93c362","Ugh, whatever! Rikka, can you just give us a spark?"
"b93c18f","Just a second, Himari. Something's wrong with them."
"a93c01c","Huh?"
"993bea9","..."
"893bd36","..."
"793bb43","?!"
"693b9d0","Wait... Myotismon? Piedmon?"
"1593d14d","What was...
What's going on?"
"1493cfda","What's this?! I can't move my legs!"
"13960cde","No! It's a trap!"
"14960eb1","Myotismon, what is this? Wait! Why are you attacking me?!"
"119609f8","Ugh... You can move, can't you {0}?
Quick, help!"
"de226c76","So this wasn't enough after all. I suppose I'd better
prepare the next stage of the party."
"dd226a83","Wh-wha-what?!"
"dc226910","Gyaah!"
"e3227415","Agh! Kouta!"
"e22272a2","Himari!"
"e12270cf","!!!"
"e0226f5c","Kouta! Himari! Where are they being taken?"
"e7227a41","That was a Gate. I can't sense Himari or Myotismon or the
others nearby anymore, either."
"e62278ee","That voice... It said something about a ""next stage."""
"d92025e0","Let's hurry back to Floatia! We have to find out where
Himari and the rest have gone, and go help them!"
"26daa299","Hmm. Well, this sure went south fast."
"23da9dc0","Lucemon, Beelzemon...you say you might know something about
this enemy?"
"24da9fb3","Some time ago, we felt a certain presence. It was oddly...
familiar. Like we'd felt it before."
"29daa752","It only lasted a moment, but it had a terrible force.
Do you recall that we were once in the Demon World?"
"2adaa8c5","We Seven Deadly Digimon were in a place apart from this
world, known as the Dark Area."
"27daa40c","Each of the Seven commanded great power, and the Dark Area
was under our control."
"28daa5ff","Still, the Dark Area was a land of darkness and ruin."
"2ddaad9e","Fighting amongst ourselves wouldn't help. We forged a pact
of nonaggression, at least on the surface."
"2edaaf71","We built a new base in the Dark Area, and decided to all
reside there together."
"2bdce92f","That way, we could all keep one another in check, watching
to make sure none raised an army to break the treaty."
"2adce7bc","That place was what you call the Demon World."
"2ddcec75","Each of us built our own palace there, and lived boring
lives...but with the freedom to do as we pleased."
"2cdcea82","But one day, the Demon World began to collapse. All our
palaces were swallowed by darkness at the same moment."
"27dce2e3","We knew not why, nor how to stop it. We fled the Dark Area
and traveled to the Dimensional Sea."
"26dce170","Then we found ourselves in this world. Damaged from our
travel between dimensions, we drifted into a long sleep..."
"29dce5c9","We were awoken by Reincarnation. The rest of the story,
{0} can attest to."
"28dce456","We believe the mysterious darkness you felt back there may
be the same one that destroyed our world."
"33dcf587","We still don't know exactly what it was. And now it's here,
intruding in this world as well..."
"32dcf414","Hmph. So even if this's the same enemy, we're no closer to
knowing exactly what it is."
"b9d579d4","Well, you could certainly call what we saw a ""mysterious
darkness."""
"bad57b47","It seemed like Myotismon and Piedmon were possessed by
something, too. I doubt they'd betray us of their own will."
"bbd57d3a","But this time, the darkness spoke. It had a conscious will,
enough even to set a trap."
"bcd57ead","It must have grown more fearsome."
"b5d573a8","Well, at least now it's a known unknown. Now, let's work out
how we're going to save Himari and Kouta!"
"b6d5751b","Indeed. There may be a way to pinpoint their location."
"b7d5768e","Aha! What's that?"
"b8d57861","We'd trace the Bonds between Rikka and Himari, and Yukimura
and Kouta, in what's known as the Rite of Bonds."
"b1d56d7c","But there's one problem. Given my Taoist powers, the rite
may take a considerable time. Possibly several days."
"b2d56eef","Our enemy has a power that could destroy whole worlds! Who
knows what could happen to Himari in that kind of time?"
"3fd88b5d","Well, like it or not, we've got no other way."
"3ed889ea","Ugh. Well, then we should start as soon as we can."
"3dd88877","Wait."
"3cd88684","!"
"3bd88511","Let me lend you my power. It should speed up the rite."
"3ad883be","Kuzuhamon... Thank you!"
"39d881cb","I couldn't simply allow this world to fall to some unknown
enemy."
"38d88058","This way, then."
"37d87ee5","Our Taoist powers were never meant for combat. They're
closer to being a kind of divination."
"36d87d72","Now then, Taomon, let's show them what we're really worth!"
"add0e9e2","Please, just use the strength of our Bonds however you can
so we can find them as soon as possible!"
"aed0eb55","The sign of thunder... It moves."
"abd0e69c","Is that...Kouta?"
"acd0e80f","Oh?"
"a9d0e3b6","It's Kouta. He's on the second ship in MOD Cape."
"aad0e529","Really?! Let's go then, right away!"
"a7d0e050","Can't you find Himari?"
"a8d0e1c3","Not yet. The rite must continue."
"b5d0f65a","I understand. Please keep at it, then."
"b6d0f7cd","Well then, {0}, you and Yukimura had better get
going towards MOD Cape."
"b3d331eb","We'll contact you when we've found Himari. Good luck!"
"8f63ee57","There he is! Kouta!"
"9063efca","Are you all right? Wait..."
"9163f1bd","Hmm? Oho."
"8a63e6b8","You found this place faster than I had expected. Splendid!
But how did you... Well, never mind."
"8b63e82b","But too bad! This specimen has already provided me the data
I need on these ""humans"" who fight for this world!"
"8c63e99e","Kouta, what are you saying?"
"8d63eb71","Just my conclusion. It seems that these humans are no
serious threat."
"8663e00c","It's in Kouta! We can't hurt it like this."
"8763e1ff","Ha ha! How true. It seems I've taken your friend hostage.
But I've no need for hostages to defeat the likes of you!"
"946634ed","Aha, but I may have an even better use for this vessel. You
there!"
"9366337a","?!"
"92663187","I'll be taking your power now."
"91663014","This power...the dark Gate!"
"90662ea1","Now as for you nuisances, how about you dance for me?"
"8f662cce","!!!"
"a98601b4","Ugh..."
"ac86060d","Yukimura, he's..."
"ab86049a","Damn it. Now he's suffering instead of me."
"a685fcfb","I can barely move. Please, {0}, save
Yukimura for me."
"a585fb08","I'll handle this."
"a885ffc1","We've found Himari, too. She's in the graveyard on the west
side of Bony Resort."
"a785fe6e","Rikka's already on her way. Hurry up and meet her there."
"11f6fa6a","Thanks for coming. I heard about Kouta and Yukimura."
"10f6f8f7","Himari should be around here somewhere..."
"ff6f704","Aha! There!"
"ef6f591","You've come. Ho ho, seems like things went well on the other
side."
"df6f43e","And yet, here you are anyway. Think you're ready for me, do
you?"
"cf6f24b","Well, unfortunately for you, no matter how you grovel and
beg for your life..."
"bf6f0d8","You'll never sway me from my goal."
"af6ef65","Ho ho ho. Now, shall we begin?"
"9f6edf2","Himari! No! Ugh, but if I get close, it'll take me like it
took Yukimura..."
"8cf3ea54","Well, then. It looks as if we've got no more use for this
human."
"8df3ebc7","What'll we do? Take a sword and slice it up?"
"8ef3edba","Not bad, but hear me out: why don't we light a fire and
watch it burn?"
"8ff3ef2d","Don't you lay a hand on Himari!!!"
"88f3e428","Ngh! Aaaah!"
"89f3e59b","Ho ho. Hook, line, and sinker."
"8af3e70e","Now let's reel this one in as well."
"6bd6d6ed","Rikka... Rikka! No..."
"68d6d214","..."
"69d6d387","Let's go back. We need to get Himari some rest."
"ca33ac70","You're back!"
"cd33b0c9","We've sent Himari back to the real world for a while to
recuperate, same as Kouta."
"cc33af56","Seems like Kouta still can't quite get up."
"cf33b42f","So the enemy kidnapped Kouta in order to analyze a human's
power..."
"ce33b2bc","Could be that process drained the power out of him."
"d133b775","As long as we humans are in this world, we don't get worn
down from hunger or lack of sleep."
"d033b582","Then how did Kouta end up as he did, I wonder?"
"d333ba5b","Jijimon!"
"d233b8e8","What's the matter?"
"e531981a","This was outside!"
"e631998d","Wait...a letter?"
"e3319534","It must be from the enemy. And yet it's not like that
tattered one from before."
"e43196a7","I'll give it a read."
"e13191ee","""You are cordially invited to return to the Pink Stone House
at your convenience."
"e2319341","This time, even more fun awaits you on the way."""
"df318e88","Hrmm. Wait!"
"e031907b","It's signed...from the Malevolent Fist?"
"dd318ba2","Does this mean it's grown stronger by absorbing our culture?"
"de318d15","We'd better hurry it up. Rikka and Yukimura must be at the
Pink Stone House."
"df2f5011","I'm worried about that ""fun"" it mentioned waiting for us
along the way through Bony Resort."
"de2f4ebe","Sending this invitation while Kouta and Himari are out of
action... It must be trying to gauge our strength."
"dd2f4ccb","{0}, you and your team are the only ones we
can count on to dive in and eliminate this danger."
"dc2f4b58","Can you do it?"
"e32f565d","I suppose I didn't need to ask. We're on the same page."
"e22f54ea","If anything goes wrong, we'll send reinforcements, but
you're the best fighters we've got. We're counting on you!"
"a9cc1925","Dear guests, are you enjoying yourselves?"
"a6cc146c","Do relax for a while before you go farther."
"a7cc15df","I think what we need here is a touch of excitement."
"a4cc1106","Ha ha ha, go have a great time!"
"a5cc12f9","The real fun is just beginning."
"a2cc0e20","Hope you'll indulge us in a little low comedy."
"aece5fbb","You can't go any farther! There must be some invisible wall."
"7918e9e2","...!"
"7818e80f","..."
"7718e69c","..."
"7618e529","So you've made it here. Well, it's just about time anyway."
"7518e3b6","The power I borrowed from you and your friends... What was
it called? Ah, yes, ""Bond."""
"7418e1c3","It took some effort to make it useful, I admit."
"7318e050","But look! It's reversed; I've inverted the very principle
behind it!"
"8218f7cd","Now it fills me with power instead. I call it a ""Dark Bond.""
What do you think of that name?"
"8118f65a","It just needed one last pinch of spice. But this should be
perfect."
"7416a36c","Now, see for yourself. It's showtime!"
"7516a4df","!!!"
"7616a6b2","Ha ha ha ha! Perfect!"
"7716a825","Hmm, I see. This will do nicely! I've attained a new
darkness... Myotis...? Pied...? No, never mind."
"70169d20","Would you give me a moment to think of a name? It's so very
important, after all."
"71169e93","Ah, no, no. The real party still awaits!"
"7216a006","I've got to go back and get ready. So much to do!"
"7316a1f9","Come to think of it, you could say this is my own birthday
party, in a way! Celebrating my birth!"
"7c16afc4","Oh, I'm so excited. I've got a present for you inside the
house."
"982885eb","Ungh..."
"9928875e","Guh..."
"9a288931","Yukimura! Rikka! Are! You! Oh! Kay?!"
"9b288aa4","We saw a huge pillar of darkness burst up as we were on our
way! Did that thing take shape?"
"9c288c17","..."
"9d288d8a","So, Myotismon and Piedmon fused...and the Malevolent Fist is
somehow also a part of that fused entity?"
"9e288f7d","Kouta, Himari, Yukimura, and Rikka...all had their Bond
powers absorbed for this."
"8f287780","They're all messed up! Do you...do you think they can go
back to normal?!"
"90287973","Can't say for sure yet."
"9d2acc61","{0}..."
"9c2aca8e","The Malevolent Fist represents an...unthinkable evil. It's a
crisis for the entire Digital World."
"9b2ac91b","Still, I have faith. We all have faith."
"9a2ac7a8","We won't let anyone who hurts our friends get away with it!"
"a12ad2ad","And at times like these, our best hope is always you."
"a02ad13a","Yeah, {0}! Go go GO! FIGHT!"
"9f2acf47","Now, get going."
"9e2acdd4","I'll take care of Yukimura and Rikka. I have a feeling their
Bond powers will return if they can be with their partners."
"23d38","Welcome."
"30241f1","You certainly took your time. Though thanks to that, I got
to take my time as well."
"202401e","I've come up with a name for myself. Would you like to hear
it?"
"50244d7","It's...Boltboutamon."
"4024364","Ha ha! What do you think? Isn't it elegant...
Isn't it refined?"
"702483d","Well, that's not much of a reaction. You ought to show the
respect this occasion deserves."
"602464a","Ah, wait, that's right. I suppose it's because your life is
nearly over."
"f9023233","Oh, but don't worry, you won't be alone. This whole world
will go with you."
"f8023040","There seems to be a huge base for the power I seek here.
So I'm going to take all of it."
"fafff6a2","My...no, OUR goal is to swallow up all of this old darkness
and mix it together into a new dark power."
"fbfff815","You humans know this well, don't you? The newest products
always perform better."
"f8fff35c","The old is just a foundation for the new. Such is its
purpose."
"f9fff4cf","Oh, don't you look puzzled? I think you'll understand when
you see my power in action."
"f6fff076","I made this body first so that no one could escape me in
this world, after all."
"f7fff1e9","Though I did just use whatever materials I had. There's
certainly room for improvement."
"f4ffed10","Now, let's begin the banquet of blood, the feast of madness!"
"e4f2a77b","{0}!"
"e5f2a8ee","Just in time."
"e6f2aa41","Well, we can't miss this opportunity."
"e7f2ac34","Everyone get in formation, now!"
"e8f2ada7","Well, now. I believe I've seen some of these faces before."
"e9f2af1a","Pleasure to meet you, and goodbye. You're about to be wiped
from this world."
"eaf2b08d","This should work. Follow my timing."
"dbf29910","How annoying. Oh, well... Here you go."
"dcf29a83","Hm? What's this?"
"e9f4edf1","It didn't work? No...!"
"e8f4ec1e","Ha ha, oh, it worked. It just...didn't work good enough."
"e7f4eaab","Ugh! You monster!"
"e6f4e938","This is as far as you go."
"edf4f43d","...This is it."
"ecf4f24a","We were so close..."
"ebf4f0d7","No..."
"eaf4ef64","Alas, I believe the party's ending. I'm a bit tired of all
these guests."
"e1f4e119","Though it was an enjoyable time. I got to make a backup of
this body as well."
"e0f4dfa6","I believe I'll retire for now."
"eff735fa","But I'm loath to give up easily, and I am very patient,
if I do say so myself."
"f0f7376d","Enjoy your moment of peace until the next party begins! Ha
ha ha ha ha..."
"edf73294","It vanished. Did it get away?"
"eef73407","Another minute and we would have defeated it!"
"ebf72f4e","Don't get greedy...but we succeeded for now. We drove him
off, didn't we?"
"ecf73121","Ah..."
"e9f72c68","Huh? The...the party...?"
"eaf72ddb","Ho ho ho, look at this crowd! We've even got Beelzemon and
Lucemon! What's the occasion?"
"e7f72902","You don't remember? Never mind, we'll tell you later."
"e8f72af5","Nice work, {0}.
Let's head back to town."
"d2300432","My, my, my, how did things end up like this?"
"d130025f","Even I, Myotismon, was defeated."
"d03000ec","Ho ho ho, how grateful we are to you for returning our
bodies to us!"
"cf2fff79","But he said he created a backup?"
"ce2ffd86","Yes."
"cd2ffc13","We'd better get ready for the next time we have to fight
Boltboutamon. We've got a struggle ahead of us."
"cc2ffaa0","Do you really think it'll be that bad?"
"db30121d","I know I'm done with parties for a while."
"da3010aa","Oh, Himari, Kouta! You're back to normal?"
"4d2cf43c","Thankfully so!"
"4e2cf5af","Well, I guess I might go if it was a REAL party."
"4f2cf702","Ha ha, well, a welcome-back party for you two wouldn't be so
bad."
"502cf8f5","Oooh, let's do it!"
"492cedf0","Well, shall we use my place...?"
"4a2cef63","No thanks, I'm good! Somewhere in town sounds fine!"
"4b2cf0d6","Riiiight! Anywhere's fine as long as you're all there!"
"4c2cf249","I hope we can count Boltboutamon as one of our fellow
townspeople someday."
"552d0094","Yeah... Me too, {0}, Mr. Mameo!"
"562d0207","You cleared the Add-On Scenario ""From the Malevolent Fist!"""
"d3b31f53","You're late! I've been waiting and waiting for you."
"d4b320c6","Oh, no need to look so surprised. It was no challenge to
come back to this place."
"d5b322b9","Although I wasn't able to make it out of here. Those
barriers that Omega-Alter-what-have-you put up are a bother."
"d6b3242c","So I had little choice but to invite you back to play some
more. Ha!"
"d7b3259f","Oh, I'm weary of talking. Let the killing begin!"
"d8b32772","Hm. Not yet, I see. Disappointing, but I'll have to retreat
for now."
"d9b328e5","Do come again. As many times as you want. Remember, I don't
like to give up, and I have plenty of patience."
"9bde8912","I wonder how this will go. When you're all set, talk to
Myotismon."
"9ade87bf","I'm 80% certain this is a trap. Don't slack in your battle
preparations."
"99de85cc","Aw, wait! Even if we go to the party, we can't eat the food!"
"98de8459","I'll eat enough for the both of us."
"97de82e6","What'll we do if it's one of those weird parties? What if
the police come and search the place?!"
"96de8173","It sounds like you don't mind the idea, Kouta. I'm not sure
I admire that."
"95de7f80","I wish I could fight too... I wanna go to the party!"
"a4de977d","An invitation to a trap? How...quaint. I'm curious to see
who or what is behind it."
"a3de958a","Not yet, then? Heh. Still working on your outfit?"
"96dc429c","Ho ho ho, how long it's been since I tumbled for a crowd!
...And how I hope I get the chance now."
"97dc440f","Noir's investigating for traces of anyone having broken in."
"98dc45e2","It does look like someone or something came in, but the
data's been obscured somehow. I can't make it out right."
"99dc4755","Oh, are you ""party people""? Or wait, is it ""peety parple""?
I always forget."
"92dc3c50","Oh, yeah, don't worry about it. Go enjoy the party."
"a139b79f","We've got to rescue Kouta as soon as possible. We don't know
what the enemy means to do with him."
"a239b972","We'll search for Himari next. I'll leave Kouta to you."
"a339bae5","Yukimura's gone ahead to the MOD Ship. I hope everyone finds
Himari soon, too..."
"9c39afe0","For now, I'm just glad we found Kouta. But we'll contact you
as soon as we have anything on Himari."
"9d39b153","So there was no party after all! Foul play!"
"9e39b2c6","The Rite of Bonds... It seems I still have plenty to learn."
"9f39b4b9","Don't talk to me. I'm concentrating."
"a839c284","What's wrong, aren't you going to save your friend?"
"a939c477","Hm, the Rite of Bonds. I didn't know we had anything like
it. How fortunate that the partners were still around."
"a63bfe15","Kouta... Himari..."
"a53bfca2","What does it mean to do with its captured humans? It's
getting harder and harder to figure out this enemy."
"a43bfacf","Look at all this uproar! You know you can ask me for help
anytime, right?"
"a33bf95c","You'd better not stick your nose into this, Rina. The
Digimon around town already look at you funny."
"653ef424","Rikka's gone on ahead. Head for the graveyard in the Bony
Resort."
"683ef8fd","I've thanked Kuzuhamon already. We must hurry and rescue
Himari."
"673ef70a","We'll take care of Kouta here. I'm worried about Yukimura,
but Himari comes first."
"623eef6b","Kouta's all faint! Guess he's sleeping it off in the
""ree-yull world."""
"613eedf8","If Yukimura's been kidnapped, then I worry that Rikka may be
the next target."
"643ef2b1","Yukimura got taken in place of Kouta? Maybe Rikka shouldn't
go along on this one..."
"633ef0de","I understand, but she can't stay behind. We don't know for
certain that she's in danger."
"5e3ee93f","Its methods are different than when we encountered it in the
Demon World, but there's no denying that wave I felt."
"5d3ee74c","It followed us all the way to this world. It must just act
indiscriminately."
"2bbd751","Just what in the world is the Malevolent Fist, anyway?"
"ffbbd298","I'm sure I don't need to tell you this, but...do take care
with your next target."
"bbd40b","Looks like the enemy's stopped in Bony Resort. I guess it
can't use Myotismon's transportation powers anymore."
"5bbdc2a","I bet Kouta and Himari are worried about Yukimura and Rikka
too... I'm not having a good time of it either!"
"6bbdd9d","The Malevolent Fist can overcome even the Deadly Digimon?
The Digital World is steeped in such changes."
"3bbd8c4","Looks like the Malevolent Fist has all the materials it
needs. It's up to us to launch the counterattack."
"4bbdab7","If it can't be killed, then we'll need to seal it away.
Let's work out how we're going to handle it."
"f9bbc906","It must have studied how to conquer this solid world. Tch.
What a pain in the butt."
"fabbcaf9","It grew by learning our culture. I get the attraction.
There's more power here than in the Demon World."
"14d49ce","The very idea of stealing the power of Bonds between humans
and Digimon... What a fearsome thing we're dealing with."
"4d485b","It forced Myotismon and Piedmon to fuse... Well, or perhaps
it simply was born from absorbing their power."
"ff4d46e8","Even in this dark hour, as long as we have you, our faith
will remain strong."
"64d51ed","I'll be cheering for you as loud as I can, so don't worry,
{0}! You can win for sure!"
"54d507a","Yukimura and Rikka are only sleeping because they're linked
to Kouta and Himari in the real world. No need to worry."
"44d4e87","Noir's investigating something right now. It could help you
out."
"34d4d14","There are centers of dark power appearing in the Pink Stone
House. If I can analyze them, I may find something useful."
"fa4d3ec9","Time to take revenge for our old world. Long as that thing
gets defeated, I don't mind if it's you who does it."
"f94d3d56","A new darkness has been born from the Malevolent Fist. Heh.
I don't think I'm going to like this one."
